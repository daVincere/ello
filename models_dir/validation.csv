0,"How do I get over a friendship?
Hi all,
I have gotten over people in the past... but having trouble here.  The problem is that they treat all their other friends so good - but not me.  So, it just hurts even more to get over this (I am the one ending the friendship because of how they treat me).  I think I could get over it, if they were just a jerk or a bad friend - but they're not.  They're just a bad friend to me.  Any advice would be so helpful just to read and know maybe I'm not alone with the kind of pain.",ND
1,"I moved 2,000 miles away for college six years ago. Parents have never visited
I'm unsure how to feel.  I moved to the other side of the country (USA) six years ago because I was accepted to a wonderful school in California.  My parents aren't too wealthy but are firmly middle class.  I could not afford to trac back home because I was barely living paycheck to paycheck until recently.  I paid for everything myself - textbooks, housing, transportation.  Of course, they helped out a bit as holiday gifts, but I've never received a care package or any extra aid.  

I am graduating next month and feel a bit sad that my parents aren't even sure they want to come for my graduation or party (that I'm paying for myself!).  My mom said she's busy with work and has to coordinate a lot.  She always says ""maybe next summer we'll make a trip out there!""  I'm the first person in my family to graduate college and it's kinda sad that nobody in my family cares to recognize how hard it was to do this on my own.  

I last called my dad in mid-December for his birthday.  I wanted to see how long it would take him to actually call me.  It's been three months and I've not heard a word from him.  

I was thinking about going back home this summer for a month, but am starting to question whether I should or not.  I love my life here and wish they cared enough to see it.  They have no clue what I do for work, what my degree is in, or where exactly I live.  It's been six years!  My mom just bought a house so I know she's at least had some money for a $300 plane ticket.  

What should I do?  Visit this summer and pretend everything is fine?  Wait it out and see how long it takes one of them to call me?  Should I beg them to come to my graduation/party (I've already asked several times). I feel so awkward making up excuses for them all the time (my friends often ask when my family is coming to visit). 

Thanks! ",ND
2,"feeling betrayed
My best friend and I are dating two guys who are also best friends and roommates. At first we all got along great and had a lot of fun. Out of nowhere my best friends boyfriend started voicing how he really felt about me. He told her and my boyfriend (his best friend) that he hates me and can’t stand to be around me. He even said “seeing her is the worst part of my day.” This is only one of many many rude and uncalled for things he has said about me. He acts as though I am a nuisance when I have never done anything to him. My boyfriend and I can’t even be around them anymore because of how bad it’s gotten. It hurts that my friend allows this to happen and wants to be with someone who acts like this. It’s weighing heavily on me.  ",ND

I’ve been friends with this guy for a few months now. At first things were really great and he was a really good friend, but the past two months he’s been a major DICK. I’ve been keeping my distance and not really talking to him as much. I have 3 weeks to either fix this failing friendship or get rid of it. I’ve decided that if it doesn’t get better in the next week, i will spend the following week trying to get rid of this friendship, and the third week dealing with the aftermath. I just don’t know how to, if i need to, end this friendship without being a major dick in return. He’s friends with a lot of people in my friend “network” perse and is even dating one of my best friends, so i want to leave him on good terms as to not cause any problems. advice?",ND
5,"I cut off my best friend because she was a flake NOW she wants me back ( Am I wrong for declining?)
**TLDR**: I cut off my Best friend of 5 years for being flakey and unreliable this summer. She tries to guilt trip me into taking her back. She bought me a gift while visiting in Korea and wanted to give it to me this Saturday. I said ok at first but sent her a text this morning declining the gift and the offer. I feel guilty. Am I wrong? 


**Long Story (detailed)**:   
      
   My friend and I had been friends since high school ( I am now 23 and she is now 21). I ended our friendship this summer after giving her numerous chances over the years. Long story shortish, she would never keep her word when it came to meeting up, she was super inconsistent and only really reached out when it was convenient for her. She would always be ""too busy"", she'd change our plans to hang out with others, or she'd flake out all together and not call or show. We both went to separate colleges in different towns so meeting up was hard and hanging out regularly was pretty difficult. I was always the one who would reach out to see how she was doing and I was always the one to initiate are hang out sessions. We would make plans to meet up a month in advance and the week of our planned day, she would flake out. After a while, I started calling her out and she would beg and cry exclaiming that she would change, but she never did. I would text her and she'd never text back. I called her once after a hard day at school and she rushed me off the phone but whenever she would call me for help and advice I was always there front and center ready to listen. I would ask her to help me out and she bail at the last minute due to scheduling conflict or her failing to think ahead. I once asked her to pick me up from the airport. I asked 3 times if she was sure if she could and she reassured me that she'd be able to. A couple of days before the day that she was supposed to pick me up, she calls me talking in circles only to tell me that she couldn't do it. I was broke and couldn't really afford a lyft. Luckily I was able to reach my dad. 
      

  Over the summer things got even worse. She turned 21 and I had tried several times to link up and take her out. She bailed both times. The first time she bailed because I guess she forgot that she needed to pick up her aunt from the airport. The second time she made date night plans with her boyfriend. It continued to persist. she was teaching me how to drive but didn't think enough of me to let me know when she was going to cancel. Instead, she ghosted me for a week only to blame it on the fact that she was too busy to text me or call me. 
      In September, I had had it! I deleted her on facebook and i blocked her number. She added me back a week later and then I blocked her. Feeling bad, November I reached out one last time to see if we could talk things through. She said that she missed me and was too sad to talk in person and that she need time to process what happened. I rolled my eyes at the text and said whatever. Toward the end of the month (November 19th to exact) she reaches out to me telling me about how sorry she is how awful of a friend she was. I vented my frustrations and she said apologized and alluded to wanting yet another chance. I said ok and we planned to meet on December 22nd. 
      

   A few days before December 22nd, she texts me saying that the 22nd didn't work for her. She tried to place the blame on me by saying that I knew that she had job training that day and that I should've picked another day. I went off, She begs, I say whatever. Sometime goes by and we talk again and I explain everything that is on my mind. I tell her that its cool to be busy but its also important to make time for the people in her life. She didn't really respond because I guess it was finals week on her end. I told her that I would always be there for her and I wished her the best of luck.
       

On New Years she texted me telling me that she had been thinking about me and she wished me a Happy New Year. I did the same. A few days later she texts me saying that she bought me a gift in Korea (where she had been visiting) and I said ok? I was a little irritated because I know that it was just another nice-nice sappy guilt trip manipulation ploy. We settled for meeting up on Saturday. however after thinking about it, I texted her today and told her that meeting up isn't a good idea. I told her that while she is a very sweet person and that I appreciated the gift, I do not trust her. I told her that I have since moved on and healed from the situation. I included that if she wanted to speak on the phone on Saturday that we could but outside of that I would not feel comfortable meeting up and hanging out. She texted me back a little short saying ""Oh ok"" and she asked if she could text me later. I said sorry and told her to take care. 
   

  *Am I wrong? I feel a little guilty for how messy this entire thing has been but Im over feeling used and manipulated. She thinks that if she ""gives"" me gifts and or cries and begs for me to give her another chance that I give in. I mean it this time.. Ive gone back on my word so many times with her because of guilt and not wanting to seem like a bitch. She doesnt have many friends and I was kind of her should but she always had a hard time returning the favor. Should I meet up with her and accept the gift? Or should I just let sleep dogs lie???*

8,"my parents created me and ruined me
my mother got pregnant with me just before she turned 15 and has always lived in a bad environment this lead to her using drugs and misusing alcohol. my father is 4 years older then my mother so he was 19 when my mother got pregnant. none of this is a problem other then my mothers bad choices. my parents split up when I was a baby and so growing up I was fed lies about both my life became a contest of who id love the most. lots of other things happen around the time I turn 10 and I then I started to live with my father and my three half brothers where taken away. my father never really did anything to help me cope with the separation and my mother has ran away by the time I found out. for the last 5 years my mother would occasionally contact me and talk about how things will change but nothing ever did.
 within the second year of me living with my father him and his wife decide to have a baby this happens and I get a new brother  who I am extremely attached to and love so much. This was fine until I was being neglected and cast out by my stepmother because I'm not her child and she didn't want me in the first place, she was just to desperate not to lose my father. so now that they have a baby things go her way a lot more. ( none of my family on my fathers side like my stepmother as she had a much better childhood and has become very stuck up from it ) I then stop spending as much time with them as I began to feel unwanted and my father has now become a very angry and belittling man who is uninterested in anything other than his laptop and phone. they began punishing me harshly for small things and neglecting my needs for example feeding me. because I had to earn my money to buy my own food if I didn't do everything they asked they wouldn't give me the money I needed to eat. so when I was 14 I started to lose weight as i had recently  met a boy that I liked and we would go for walks  and the obvious reason was that I couldn't afford to eat everyday but I did as my grandmother was secretly feeding me and giving me everything I needed and wanted as she noticed that I wasn't getting it. because my father and his wife are both very large people and visibly overweight they became angry that I was losing weight. they would regularly humiliate me in front of my relatives saying that I'm starving myself ( I wasn't I just really liked my now boyfriend and he enjoys walking)  the older I got the worse it become until it got to  my 16th birthday where it had gotten to the point they had gotten me my provisional driving licence and the cbt lesson so I can get a moped. this may seem nice but up until this point my birthday was just a garneted meal for me. they had also told my family to only give me money which they have taken and refused to give back no this day. their motive for doing this for me was so I had transport to the job they where forcing me to get so I had to start paying rent for my room.(my room is the place where things my father has that she doesn't like goes. this wasn't a problem to me as my father spends more money than he has on some really cool stuff) also useful information they claim money for me and have never told me this so they would also make me earn everything that I had and most of the things I had I paid for myself with the money I earned by doing everything they didn't want to do like pick my brother up from his school when he started going to the school playgroup. the only thing I didn't pay for was my phone.  when I was 15 I became qualified to look after children so they decided to misuse this and make me look after my brother more than I would have liked coz it took time away from my social life and school work. they would promise to pay for my time but they never did and in fear I would be punished and made to do more work without pay I didn't say anything. 
on the day of my cbt my stepmother dropped me there and then left to go see her family for the rest of the day. this is fine but I unfortunately couldn't do the practical text which was driving on the road so they sent me home early. I was stranded in a town that was very far  from the town I live in and had nobody to come get me. but luckily I found my friend shopping in the town with her brother and I went home with them. while on the way home I had text my stepmother explaining I wasn't ready to do the practical test, as it was too dangerous because I couldn't control the bike well enough to drive on a road safely. a few minuets later my father begins texting me angrily saying that ive wasted their money and to get a job ad pay for everything myself because I had apparently refused to get on the bike and just left the lesson. because of this I got home and packed a bag and went to my mothers parents house to stay and I had no intention of ever going back to live with my father and still don't as it has been 5 months since I left.
when I first left I stayed at my mothers parents house which was two towns away from where my father lives. that only lasted for a night though and in that space of time he had come there to see me and bring me my phone as I had left it ( he had a tracking devise on it so he always new where I was) and has started texting me on my Facebook saying that I am just like my mother and lots of other horrible things like I'm on drugs and pregnant and that I'm a slut and he also said he was going to get my boyfriend arrested. within a week I lived in the same town as my father as I still have to attend school but I am still refusing to go back I now live with my grandmother ( fathers mother
) and occasionally live at my boyfriends house for a week or so depending how I feel . 
within these last two months I have been in contact with social services as I want my things and money back and I also want contact with my brother but I don't want my father or his wife  to be present during the contact as I want nothing to do with them . 
last week I went there with my friends that have been helping me through the satiation of seeing my brother and his wife made him tell us to get out and them when I decided to leave she slammed the door on us at first then came out saying I'm not aloud to see him again. during this time I have found out that my father has lied to me about things all my life for example he always told me that he didn't know how old my mother was. this was proven to be a lie as my mother now lives not to fa away from me as she just got out of prison and she and others have told me about how my father attended her 16th birthday party and by then she was pregnant . I know am extremely confused about trusting people and have developed some sort of mental illness that my doctor has ignored to help me with. I'm now experiencing depressive and hyperactive episodes and will tend to black out and forget thing that have happened during long 
amounts of time . I don't know how to handle this situation can someone please give me advice on getting help and moving on with my life.    ",ND

AH IM IN SUCH A DILEMMA. Basically I have this friend whom I’ve known for 10+ years and we’ve always been quite different but were good friends nonetheless. Over the past 3 years this friends true colours have been slowly creeping out and its been really affecting me! Most recently she did some that was way out of line and really made me question who she is! I’ve tried cutting her out slowly and distancing myself but I can’t really escape it since our university campuses are the same and she’s recently joined a club I’m in! She’s basically just so fake around me and is so nice to everyone else and I ignore it and let it slide but the thing she did that was way out of line is something I can’t get over? She also always makes me feel guilty for what I have and always makes me out to be just ‘lucky’ but nothing I have ‘have’ is due to luck! It’s literally pure hard work??? And now that she’s joining this club it’s gonna make things 1000x worse because she’s just going to show off to all the guys and be this super fake ass person? She thinks she can get away with it and basically try walk all over me just because she’s known me for ages cause otherwise she literally follows everyone else like a sheep? I’ve tried confronting her about her actions but she just laughs it off??? How can I just get over it all ready?? It’s really beginning to affect my mental health 😭 like I didn’t really speak either her over the last 2 months and I’ve never been happier but seeing her around college more literally makes my blood boil she’s honestly just so toxic and I feel like hanging with her in this club is going to ruin my reputation and what others think of me!

TL:DR Friend has overstayed their welcome, how to politely ask her to leave?

4 months ago, my friend was going through a rough time.  She had split up with her partner and was struggling to find somewhere to live. My fiance and I own our home and had a spare room so offered her to stay, till her work contract was up in February, for a very very low rent (it's a quarter of what people pay in our area).  So now we're in february she has a renewed contract at work and isn't looking at places to live.  Little things she does around the house bug me, but thats probably just because its our home and not a shared rental.  However recently I've suffered a string of ill health (multiple hospital admissions) and now i'm home I just want my own space! She has cut her work hours to look for a new job but barely looks and just sits around the house.  I feel like i'm cleaning up after her all the time, plus she is always eating our food.

Long story short, I have an 8 year old cousin and I don't like him. I'm 19 going on 20 by the way. My mom babysat him when he was a newborn till when he was about 2. I always felt kind of jealous because my mom completely forgot about my dad and I when she babysat him but I always kind of understood that she wasn't doing it intentionally because kids are so high maintenance at that age. Anyways, fast forward to my teen years and his young kid years and I can't stand the kid. He's such a crybaby even for his age and he doesn't like me for some reason. It started because he was taking toys from my dog and my dog started crying, so I yelled at the kid and he started to cry. I don't think I was being over the top and the kid definitely had to have someone discipline him. My mom loves him a lot and always talks about him but it pisses me off because it seems like she cares about him and his dad more than her own husband and only son. The kid does nothing but play video games on his xbox or my mom's iPad when he stays with us, Which I failed to mention is a very common occurrence. I'm starting to ramble but the main goal of this post was to find out if anyone feels the same way about any of their younger family members or if I'm just a complete asshole. ",ND

21,"My Story of Elder Abuse: Internet Romance Scams and the devastating consequences
I'm living a nightmare watching a woman 50 years younger than my 80-year-old father coerce him into marriage, manipulate him and taking his money all in the name of ""love"". The relationship started as Ghanaian romance scam (usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/romance-scams/) and after we uncovered it was a male in Ghana pretending to be an American woman, it eventually led to a Ghanaian woman residing in Cuba, showing up at my father's doorstep and coercing him into marriage two weeks later. The story is long, complex, and out of this world so I won't go into it here. We've tried it all: FBI, USICE/immigration, State Dept., AARP, private investigators, the District Attorney, police, adult protective services, elder abuse attorney's and filing for conservatorship. 

The harsh reality I'm learning is though the crime is so blatantly obvious to everyone, I'm told over and over by the authorities that individuals have the right to abuse themselves. My father is showing serious signs of dementia but his executive functioning is still intact and we cannot get him to see a neuropsychologist without a long and painful court battle. 

To the outside world, he comes across as just fine, but my normally mild-mannered, extremely rational and brilliant father has had explosive and violent episodes, personality changes, impulsive behavior, and has been unduly influenced and taken advantage of over an over again. He cannot see that people are lying to him even though the lies are later revealed to him. I've had a huge reality check just how powerful civil liberties to make bad decisions are in the USA along with the financial rights that coexist in marriage, no matter how corrupt. 

I'm not writing for advice since I know in my heart my father is not well and is no longer the father I know and love. What I want to know is if anyone else out there has experienced elder financial abuse in their family, and romance scams or partner abuse in particular. I want to hear your story. I am appalled that though financial elder abuse is rampant throughout the USA, and internet romance scams are only on the rise, there seems to be no major initiatives or policies to protect our vulnerable elders. 

Thank you.

24,"Is this kind of family interaction normal?
Hi all, I hope you can help me out. Is what my dad said to me normal? 

Backstory: I'm 24f...married...have a toddler. I was texting my mom today about several things (husband can get ribs on sale at work for them, MIL invited me and my mom to a play, things my MIL said that irritated me...etc. She was on break at work). At the end, she mentioned my dad is home sick today. Maybe I should call him. So I call him and ask him jokinging why he's sick. He said he has the flu or a cold or something. He stayed home yesterday too. Then he mumbled something offhand about how mom wasn't going to tell me because I never ask them how they are. 

Do normal parents do/say stuff like that? Won't tell their kid that one if them are sick because they don't ask how they are? It makes me feel terrible but also manipulated. It's not like my mom has never given me the silent treatment because she thinks I don't call enough. 

The thing is...I HATE small talk. I never ask anyone how they are. It feels fake and wrong to me(maybe because I don't think most people actually care about me). They(anyone) can tell me if they don't feel good. I wouldn't wait til asked to tell my close family/friends if I don't feel well. I also have social anxiety and anxiety in general. These kinds of comments make me want to call them even less. I already feel judged every time I call my mom. And I still get anxious every time my dad calls...thinking he is calling to yell or something. I just CAN'T ask. It literally feel impossible. Like I physically can't get the words out.

No names or genders here, and I'm not getting into specifics on events just in case...


I have one friend who consistently wants to hang out, unlike my other friends, but the problem is that over the last few years I've started liking them less and less. They're fun to talk to and hang out with -usually- but their personality grates on me and there have been a few times when they have made me quite angry in ways that are difficult to reconcile. They can also end up being a downer though they have been working on it. An unknown quantity of my other friends also dislike them (I know a few for sure, but who knows how many they've pissed off in the meantime) so I either have to plan events without them (and they get upset) or not invite my other friends who dislike them.


We've known each other for years, and they consider myself and a few others very close friends but I have gotten the distinct impression it's one-sided. But they haven't done anything wrong (to ME) that would really merit breaking up a friendship so I've kept begrudgingly hanging out with them and chatting with them even though I'd rather not and just forget they exist. At one point I was one of very, very few friends they had, but I know they have a good consistent friend group now so...

27,"not invited to friends party, yet others who barely know her were?
so, i wasn't invited to my close friend's party, yet i've known her for 3-4 years. countless people who don't talk to her were invited and so she can't use the excuse of that she had 'limited room/invitations.' also she mentioned to one of my friends, who was invited, that she had sent me an invitation (via text) yet I didn't respond. when it seems as if the text didn't 'go through.' but the fishy thing is that she even made a groupchat. how could a text not go through and how could she forget to add me to a groupchat? 
I'm just upset and I'm not sure what I did wrong.

28,"My mom went to go to a family gathering (I didn't go) and one of my aunt's seems to have forgotten my name. Is it reasonable to be bothered by this?
I don't see my dad's side of the family that much after I moved because its a long commute. However we still send out Christmas  cards and two of them call from time to time. 

One of my Aunts was having a retirement party and my mom went to it out of obligation more than out of wanting to. The Aunt who the party was for was welcoming and nice to her but the rest were just talking amongst themselves about politics and other crap.

One of my other Aunts who lives outside of the area (compared to us and the others) went up to my mom and said hi to her but when she asked about me she said ""How's your daughter?"".  Everyone else who asked about me asked about me by name,so my mom took notice of this and found it odd.

She told me about it when she got home and it bothered me. I was the flowergirl in the wedding for this particular Aunt, so I don't see how she could not even remember my name anymore.  Is it reasonable to be bothered by this?

I used to send them christmas cards (and I signed my name) but they haven't sent anything back in recent years. I don't feel like bothering to even try now. They send us things asking for money for their kids school from time to time but nothing else.",ND
29,"I'm annoyed and tired of living with my brother
I have lived with my brother while I'm in college. Ever since I moved in, he has never washed the dishes or swept or mopped or clean anything really. He will only wash the dishes when I'm back home for breaks, and that's because there's no one else to do it for him. Every time my parents come and visit us, I'm the one who has to clean the whole apartment. He doesn't help me with any of that. One time I just snapped because my parents were coming to visit us and I had been cleaning the apartment all day and she wanted me to wash his sheets and clean his bathroom and I said no, if there's one thing he can do when he gets home from work it's take the time to clean his bathroom and wash his sheets. My mom bitched at me because I wouldn't do it. But I'm just so tired of having to do everything myself. In case anyone asks, yes, I do pay my half of the rent with my own money. So it's not fair. I just don't know what to do anymore because I don't like saying things that might make me seem like I'm being dramatic or bratty to my parents. And they know he doesn't clean anything. They know I do it all by myself but they don't ever say anything to him. My parents are just so controlling too. They don't even let me drive anywhere out of town by myself and they sure as hell won't let me live anywhere else. I still have until December when I'll finish school that I'm still gonna have to live with my brother. I'm just so frustrated and don't even know what to do anymore.",ND

31,"Am I in a bad friendship?
I have this friend and he's actually really fun and quite an extrovert. He's cheerful most of the time. But the thing is he has anger issues and he gets pissed off at people and stuff easily including me. Whenever i play games like league of legends with him he gets so mad at me for stuff that i didn't even do and even at one point filed a complaint and wrote stuff that was completely false about me. And I used to ask him questions sometimes via text and he'd always respond but then he'd say ""you could've at least said hi"". So one time i just said a simple hi to him and you know what? he said ""I'm really not in the mood for a pointless hi"" and he seemed really moody to me especially for some reason and then he typed something ""you know i really dont know why you bother..."" i couldnt read the rest because he deleted it. But whats weird is he still wants to play league with me and stuff which i find stupid because i know hes just gonna get angry at me again and only me. he never gets angry at anyone else he plays with in that game and it makes me feel sick. So i just stopped messaging him in general. and one time he said ""you know i dont know why im so aggressive to you so lets just forget that happened"" and i didnt say much and he said ""i know you dont have much to say and i dont care so lets just forget"". He didnt even say sorry for being so mean to me. To me it just looked like someone that was trying to clean up the pile of junk he left so he doesnt need to think of it later. It makes me feel so sick to think of. And sometimes he calls me a bitch and a hoe. Like really? Why would you call your friend that? I never called him anything like that. One time he was trying to talk to me and a bunch of other people were talking over him so I couldn't hear him. Then he said ""yo bitch"". I really wanted to punch him in the face that was really hurtful like I have a name cant you at least say my dam name? Sometimes I just hate him so much and its sad because hes a fun person but he just gets stupidly pissed off and says whatever he wants without thinking how hurtful or rude it is.",ND

My husband and I had a child later in life. She's 18 months old and her grandparents on both sides are in their mid-late 60's. My parents are very healthy and I don't think of them as ""old"", so I mentioned that my daughter could live close to them if she chose to go to University in the city where they live. My mom chimed up and said that they may both be dead by then (for context, they're Chinese and it's completely normal for them to be this blunt with their children). 

I've had other family members pass away before, but it just hit me that no matter how you prepare yourself for that day, you'll never be ready to say goodbye. It's never enough time.

I immediately felt very sad for my young daughter and just hope that we have lots of time left to bond and make memories. We live 5 hours away by car, so it's hard to see them as regularly as we'd like, but we try to visit and have them visit as often as we can.

37,"I Feel Lonely and Scared I'll End Up Friendless. Need an Ear.
Ive come to the realization that I'm really scared I'll end up with no friends. I used to be the type who kept in touch with friends for years. But, I have either lost touch with or outgrown every friend I had in high school. 

The new ones I made in college are nice people for the most part and ended up being my roommate group (since sophomore year. I'm a 2nd semester junior.). But every friend group has their faults. And with this one, I don't feel like I fit in completely. 

4 out of the 7 of them are know-it-alls who will try to correct you on every little thing (like one time I was exaggerating and saying somewhere had 100x more people, and one of them came out of their room and said ""Um, I think it's actually 1000x more people."") Those 4 are also really uptight, don't get my sense of humor for the most part and seem like they're always trying to school me on what's appropriate (MIND YOU I NEVER JOKE ABOUT RACE OR OPPRESSED GROUPS OR ANYTHING OFF LIMITS LIKE THAT.). I just don't always feel seen or appreciated or like my intelligence is respected. There's also one I don't even like that much (no matter how much I've tried) because she has an arrogant, self-aggrandizing, my-way-or-highway attitude. 

The point is I don't always feel in sync with them. Even the ones I do feel in sync with, I don't feel like they reach out to me nearly as much as I reach out them (when we're not in school). And I don't like one-sided friendships. I'm worried we won't stay friends after undergrad. 

Also this year, 2 of them are graduating and I have to find a new roommate to fill in the spot that'll be in my room. I'll admit, I didn't make enough effort to hang out with people outside of my dorm, and everyone had settled into their friend groups so it's harder to make friends now with the people at my school. I don't know what to do. 

Part of me feels this is my fault for not getting a single in the first place, and trying to join this friend group when it was already established. They eventually came to see me as a member, and we've had good times but I don't know that these are ""my people"".

And part of me wants to get a single room next year, but I feel like I'll just be jumpstarting my social isolation and I'm also scaredy new roommates might be lunatics. 

Tl;dr - I've lost touch/outgrown my high school friends, don't fit in with my college friends, and am scared to end up alone without any friends. Need advice. ",ND
38,"Cousin I’ve not seen for 25+ years trash talking me to my son (sorry long post)
I just need a rant and maybe some advice on what to tell my son. 

My youngest son (15) came home last night and said he was invited to a party this weekend and could he go, after all the ‘mum checks’ I gave permission. 

He then proceeded to tell me that the mum of his friend ‘hates me and that I hate her’ and I found this odd as I don’t particularly hate anyone and certainly not one of his acquaintances mums. 

It turns out that she is a cousin of mine who I haven’t seen for 25+ years since the death of our grandfather, her father accused me of stealing my grandads Home and contents, not true but I did care for my grandfather at his home, that I bought, and my grandfather lived rent (and bill) free for 2 years prior to his death. 

When he passed away, my uncle said he wanted things from the home for himself (I had no issue with that) and when my uncle (this lady’s dad) said he wanted the TV I said he could take the rent book for it too (my grandad rented it from a local place). My uncle was pissed but accepted that it was rented. I also put into boxes all the things my grandad had willed my aunts and uncles for them to take away after the funeral - some couldn’t bear to and I put it in storage for them to take at a later date. 

Now I’ve lived in my home since then and over the years changed the house to my taste and extended it. Unbeknownst to myself (until last night) each time I changed something my uncle has bad mouthed me to other family members and run me down, convincing others that I stole the house from them (was a rental property when my grandfather moved in and it was myself who purchased it). Over the years I have noticed that my family are not very communicative with me but I’ve put it down to initially my brothers death (4 years after my grandad) and then my mums (a few years later). But after speaking to others in the family last night I’ve discovered what has been said about me. 

Now I don’t particularly give a damn about what’s said about me but I am upset that my cousin has told my son that I hate her, he is autistic and things like this stick in his head. Last night I just said something like ‘I don’t know the lady how can I hate her? And is that something you think I would do?’ To which he agreed that it wasn’t something I’d say/do. 

My problem is the party, the parents are going to be there (one of the reasons I’m allowing him to go) and I’m concerned that they will trash talk me to him and how do I explain to him that some people just believe what they want regardless of what the truth is? I don’t want to give him all this information before he goes as it’s not really a problem unless my cousin makes it one, of you see what I mean. 

Thank you if you made it this far and any advice would be appreciated. ",ND
39,"Am I being a bad friend or is she?
Hey, I'm kind of new to Reddit but I kinda need an opinion on a situation and I really hope the person I'm talking about never reads this. 

I have this close friend, (let's call her P) and lately, P and I have been having some problems. 

P is annoyed because she thinks I don't spend enough time with her. She's in one of my classes so I see her every other day for 2 hours but that isn't enough for her and she wants me dedicate my lunch time to her and spend more time texting her. She gets upset about this to the point where she sends me accusatory/passive aggressive texts during lunch about my location. Now keep in mind, I'm an honors student and I usually have club meetings or classwork to do during lunch periods and I barely see my other friends, who I'm much closer to and don't share many classes with, because of this.  
I'd be happy to spend time with her in a group of my friends (who she's also friends with) and spend time everyone but she gets mad or upset when I try to talk to my best friends.
Also, I don't really like her personality sometimes. She's kind of vain and she flirts with my friends and she likes a lot of guys for simple reasons (i.e. this one guy who's really friendly waves at her every time he sees her in the halls and she had a crush on him for two months because of that even though he wasn't interested). And she always talks about herself and gets jealous of my friendship with the waving guy she liked, to the point where I've stopped talked to him so she doesn't tell me about her dreams in which I make out with the guy in front of her and make her really jealous. 
However, she cut off most of her ties with her former friend group because they talked behind her back about how she only talks about herself and the current guy she has a crush on. 
I understand her situation and that she feels like she's losing her only friend but I really don't like being controlled and walked on.
I also feel bad about her situation and I don't want her to cry, make me look like a bad person and talk behind my back to my friends/twist the situation (which she has done before) and my friends are either telling me to cut it off with her or that I'm overreacting and a bad friend so I'm posting on here for a second, unbiased opinion.

41,"Friend dumps problems on me and that’s all we do together now
Interested in other peoples experience of this and suggestions!

Have been friends with a woman for a few years.  Started off fun, we’d go for lunch, gigs and talk about a whole range of topics in person and by text. 

For the last 6 months she’s stopped meeting up with me and responding to messages (or sending any). Instead she calls me at least once every week for often 2 - 3 hours asking for advice about men, her job and other stresses. She’ll talk for over 20 mins uninterrupted, won’t stop talking when I need to go and will call even if I’ve said I’ll be out or unavailable. 

I got married oversees recently and our conversation was 10 mins on this and the remaining 2 hours about her problems. 

She gets aggressive if I don’t offer a solution but when I cave and suggest another way of looking at things she throws it back in my face. She will often cite conversations with others where she’s gotten into an argument, and for hours will push me to give an opinion as to what she did wrong and when I diplomatically suggest doing something different or how maybe the other person didn’t mean it how it came across she will say I don’t defend her and make passive aggressive remarks. She’ll ask me to make decisions and then complains of it doesn’t give her the result she wanted!

It’s confusing and really draining. Not mention all the fun parts of our friendship have slipped away and now I’m left with her constantly calling. If I don’t pick up she just keep ringing everyday! In fact I moved House once and she complained she had withdrawals from our calls. 

Feel pretty used as she has little to no consideration of my feelings or boundaries. In fact once on a call with her I received a text saying my grandmother had died, she just said she had to go and never mentioned it again, not even to ask how I was doing. 

Would you say anything or just cut ties given how sensitive she seems?",ND

43,"Should I reach out to her or leave it alone? (TL;DR)
I had a friend and it ended pretty bad IMO. I’ve really missed her over the past couple years and I thought about re-befriending her but I’m not sure.

I’ll start with the good things about our past friendship: -she was pretty sweet to me. Very supportive of most things. -She stood up for me when like half the school picked on me for having a 2 foot bright orange Mohawk. -She tried to keep me from dating a pretty Toxic boy (but at the time I was young and wouldn’t listen) -She made me walk around the entire town with her frequently (helped me lose the weight I’d gained and build some muscle in my legs) -She was for the most part a great friend

Now the bad: -since I didn’t listen about Toxic boy, we ended up dating for about 4 years. He’s said he didn’t like her cause when they went to school together she flirted with him and when he kissed her in the hallway she told the school he sexually assaulted her and got him sent to juvie. Now while I’m not gonna go into the semantics of whether or not it was s. Assault in anyway, I will say she fully apologized to him and me for it a while back but he made me tell her that we didn’t accept her apology and to “fuck off” -She borrowed a couple box sets of shows from me around this time, those sets were given to me by favorite aunt when I was young. When I wanted them back she claimed she couldn’t find them. Almost a year went by of her “looking” for them, and I told her (mostly from Toxic boy pushing me to) if she didn’t find them by the end of the week I was going to call the police and report her for stealing them. She gave them back to me a couple days later (scratched, though I don’t know if she knew they were scratched) -I also shortly dated, and quickly broke up with one of her brothers last year (our personalities didn’t really mix well) but I don’t think she holds it against me

The manority of us breaking up was due to Toxic Boy (he’s he was toxic, he tried to fuck literally any girl friend I introduced him to) pushing me into breaking up with her, telling me she was the toxic one cause she didn’t support our relationship and cause of the juvie thing from years before.

In 2015 she reached out to me on Facebook saying: “Hey i know your probably the last person you wanna hear from but, i just wanted to say im sorry for all the bullshit that happened when i was still in school. If you don't wanna be friends thats understandable, just know thats not me anymore, and im sorry” Which, of course, Toxic boy made me to reply incredibly rudely to and our friend ship just kind of died.

So I need a second, strangers, opinion. What do I do?

44,"I want to fix my best friend and I's friendship, but I'm not sure if I should... any advice?
Hi! I'll try to make this as short as possible, but you can ask me for more details if you want to. My best friend (19/f) and I (19/f) met two years ago. We're polar opposites, but we somehow became very close, and eventually started calling each other best friends (and other nicknames haha). It was awesome, and she's the only person I feel that close with -- she's like family (though I never told her that).

Back in July though, I was feeling very drained. My best friend deals with severe depression and I was helping her a lot through it, willingly so. Honestly I felt fine for a year but I've been going through a huge identity crisis, trying to find myself and trying to know myself. I felt so confused and lost with myself -- I didn't know what I wanted anymore. It was bad. It was very exhausting for me mentally but I thought the cause of how I felt was my best friend. You might ask why I thought that, well, whenever we'd hang out, I'd have to go out of my house. I'm an introvert, and I deal with a lot of anxiety, I always feel uncomfortable being outside. But considering I'd only go outside to hang out with my best friend, I thought *she* was the problem. I took me a while but I eventually decided, even though I didn't really want to, to end the friendship. I thought this would make me feel better, like it was the key to my happiness or something.

After I overcame the ugly crying phase that lasted for a week after I ended the friendship, I was feeling really good... for only a week. It was a sense of freedom like ""I don't have to worry about anything anymore!!"". I started missing her real bad though. But I thought, hey, maybe I just miss the IDEA of her, and not really HER. So I waited to see if my feelings would change over time. 

Back in september, uni started. We shared the same classes. We saw each other again and I thought it was a good opportunity to talk to her again and explain some things out, and especially apologize to her (we had a bad argument when I told her I was ending the friendship), and she apologized too. She was really excited because some of her guy friends were with her at uni and she wanted me to hang out with them. I was still questioning a lot of things about myself at this point, and I was terribly anxious about starting uni, and also because I was scared her friends wouldn't like me or think I'm too ""innocent"" or whatever. So I chickened out and decided to avoid her. Two days later, I dropped out of uni (not because of her), and didn't say a word. I was feeling ashamed about dropping out and I had issues at home that made me feel really depressed, so I isolated myself BAD. I pushed all of my friends away, and eventually ended up alone, well, I still had some internet friends, but they didn't last long because I ended up ignoring everyone's messages. 

Fast forward to now. I still miss my best friend terribly. Some days are worse than others. I thought I'd be over it by now but I always end up crying at night because I just want to talk to her and hang out like we used to. I tried to distract myself as much as I could, and I tried to make new friends, but every time, I ended up realizing that I was just trying to find someone to replace her, which obviously didn't work out. I realized that I talk about her everyday still to my parents. My mom actually asked me how she was doing and I had to remind her that we're no longer best friends. I still think very fondly of my best friend so when I talk about her, or think about her, it's like nothing happened. I dream about her too sometimes.

I want to contact her again. I want to explain to her everything I was feeling and tell her I want us to be friends again. But I'm scared. It looks like she's completely moved on from me, and she has this new (guy) friend and they seem really close. It makes me sad because I feel like I've been replaced and I won't be able to be her best friend again. I want to be here for her, laugh with her, cry with her, hang out with her, be by her side during the best and worst moments. I don't want to be with anyone else. Just her. I can't blame her for finding new friends and moving on, also her new friend seems like a really great guy, I actually think I'd get along with him. But I don't know, it still makes me feel sad. It makes me feel like I shouldn't contact her because she doesn't need me in her life anymore and she forgot about me. I'm aware this is probably the case though.

I've been thinking of making an audio where I just talk about what's on my mind and talk about our friendship and send it to her. I'm so scared though. Is this a good idea or should I just drop it? It really makes me feel sad and I'm crying way too much over this -- I feel like, even if we can't be friends again, I need some closure. I didn't tell her everything when I ended the friendship, I only told her something like ""we don't click anymore"", I'm not even sure because it was a lie. I didn't want to hurt her feelings by saying her depression was hard for me to deal with because I also had my issues. I don't know. Sorry I'm kind of a mess haha, I hope you can still understand what I'm saying.

Also -- if you think I should do the audio thing -- do you have any advice on what to say and what not to say? I'd really appreciate it.

**TL;DR: I ended our friendship of two years because I was going through an identity crisis and she was dealing with severe depression and it made me feel terribly drained. I regret it though and I've been missing her so much but I don't know how to contact her again as she's got a new close friend and seems to have moved on.

45,"Cheap gifts on the Receiver's side
My friend and I are friends for about 5 years. We ended up going to different colleges, but kept in contact online. I think of them as my best friend, but i'm not sure if it is reciprocated. 

Every year I stress about giving a good gift for their birthday and xmas. A gift too expensive makes them feel uncomfortable by setting expectations. A gift too cheap devalues our friendship and being on the receiving end feels terrible. 

I purchased their birthday gift is about $12 (Lush soap), and the Christmas gift is about $8-10 (sweets). The price of the cards are not included. 

They got me a small notepad that looked like it came from the dollar store for my birthday, and a couple stickers for Xmas. There was no card included or even a piece of paper that had my name on it.  

Last year they got me a $15 gift with the receipt for my birthday. My gifts were around the same value (~$15).

I try not to place too much importance on the price tag, since it is the thought that counts, but their gift to me is really cheap (~$1-2), and looked like it was slapped together an hour before we met. I know they can afford to buy a gift. They buy coffee every couple days and bought lunch to the point where the staff remembered their order. 

I accepted their gift, but it was really hard to avoid showing my disappointment. I honestly thought it would of been better if they just didn't give me a gift at all.

Is this a sign? Are they trying to tell me something or do they really think of me so little? I'm not sure what they are thinking or what should I do. 

I know giving them a similarly cheap gift is an option, but I would rather know why they thought to give me this gift. I could also brush this off as a one time thing, but I think that this is not the case.

46,"My Friend is Draining Me
Apologies, this is a very long post!

I’ve been good friends with a girl for around 10 years since we were teenagers. She moved overseas around 5 years ago. She used to be such a fun, bubbly and funny person until she met her boyfriend around 3 years ago. Looking back, I can see that she was a always bit crazy and insecure (her father is emotionally abusive and tells her she’s worthless and stupid), but meeting him seems to have exacerbated all her bad qualities. She has a really low self esteem and perception issues when it comes to relationships. She also has OCD.

She was, and still is OBSESSED with her now ex boyfriend. They had an on off relationship where she thought it was normal to call him “just ten times” in one day, and would get upset and not be able  “sleep or eat” if he doesn’t reply, thinks talking on the phone three times a day is not much, they pushed and shoved each other, she hit him, he talked to other girls and acted like she wasn’t his girlfriend, she’d call his voicemail just to hear his voice, he threatened to hurt her, she considered going to a shitty college just to be near him, etc.. basically an abusive and obsessive relationship with awful communication.

Every time she messages me, she’ll ask how I am and ask a few questions, and then steer the conversation back to her numerous problems and her ex. About how she’s so poor (goes out every second night and goes on shopping sprees), how she’s really sad (but won’t see a counselor because she’s “too poor”), how she wants to be confident and independent (goes back to the ex repeatedly and doesn’t listen to any of the advice I give her), tells me she can’t eat or sleep because she’s heartbroken (I told her I was eventually okay after I broke up with an ex, but she brushed it off as I hadn’t gone out with him for as long and how she gave everything to her ex). She also says how I’m so lucky to live with my boyfriend and how I have such an amazing life, as if she’s the only person in the world that has problems.

I’ve talked to her multiple times about how talking about her ex all the time and her problems is effecting me (as well as her other friends), and how she should really see a professional as this behavior is really hurting her. She always apologizes and says that she didn’t realize how it might make me annoyed, and she’ll send me an inspirational video or inspirational words, and asking about me before going back to changing the topic so she can talk about herself, her ex and how it’s so hard for her right now, how she feels suffocated and her heart is broken. I understand that people go through hard times in their lives, but this has lasted at least 3 years. I’ve always said how I’ll be there for her and that if she needs to talk to someone, I’ll listen, but I’m starting to feel that this is a one way relationship.

The frustrating thing is that she says she agrees to everything I say, and how’s shes going to change, but nothing has changed! She says she’s more confident and doing this and that to help herself, but she just plasters selfies and videos of herself going out with people to try and convince people that she’s having an amazing time. 

I don’t want to just ignore her, but I don’t think talking to her again will do anything. I’ve been nice, brutally honest, and even angry at her and nothing has changed. She’s stuck in her own tragic world and I’m realizing that maybe she thrives in this drama, and that she’s lonely and needs a boyfriend’s attention to validate her self worth . Our other mutual friend has cut ties with her due to this. I think I have put up with this for so long as we’re not living in the same country.. 

Sorry about the long rant and formatting, I’m on my cellphone.

TL;DR friend who lives overseas is emotionally draining me every time I talk to her. I have already talked to her about it multiple times, but she always goes back to her old ways.",ND
47,"How should i deal with angry best friend
Hi guys so basically in the past year ever since I started dating a boy (he was my best friend for the most part in high school) my current best friend (a girl in my friendship group also from highshcool) and i have gotten into many fights .

These fights are mainly about her arguing that she is no longer my number one priority and that she is just second priority to my boyfriend . I do not think this is true and they are both important to me but In very different ways - he in a romantic way and she in a friendship way.

She recently came back from overseas and I organised to meet up with her and we did. I never heard from her initiating a meet up for the next few weeks or so but I finally did initiate a catch up with her after hearing nothing from her for weeks. however this plan fell through because I ended up having a work shift. 

Yesterday my best friend had invited me to catch up with her before she went to work (she had work at 1pm)and I messaged her asking if we could hang out until 12pm. She asked me why I couldn’t stay until 1 with her till she had to go to work and I explained it’s bevause I had invited my boyfriend over for lunch and movies at my house (this catch up with my boyfriend was meant to be another day but got postponed to the same day as my catchup with my best friend due to him getting sick). 

She got very angry and told me she now does not want to see me at all and cancelled the catchup because she said she felt second priority. She said She shouldn’t have to change her plans for my boyfriend who I see so much more compared to her (I would love to see her more but she never plans anything with me or when I do ask her when she’s free she always has family plans ?) 

She also brought up the previous weeks events of me cancelling our plans due to me having work and got angry with me for never trying to find another day to make up for these cancelled plans 

I tried explaining to her how important she is to me and how I don’t see her as second priority or never meant to make her feel like second priority but she is giving me silent treatment or being passive aggressive .

I am tired of having to prove to her that she is important to me and I am tired of this drama .

My boyfriend is so wonderful and he is always there for me and replies to me instantly and we share many things on a personal level (emotionally physically etc) so to me it seems natural that I will try and adjust my plans to try and accommodate him - as he does so much for me that nobody else does, not even my best friend. 
so I don’t understand why she expects to be higher in priority than my bf and isn’t happy with being the same priority as him? 

I am tired and confused. Don’t know how to respond to her passive and blunt messages to me after I tried apologising and explaining

49,"Drug addict friend!!?
I have had this best friend for over 8 years now. We were childhood friends and basically grew up together. The past 2 years were a little rough because he started to drink heavily in high school. Later on he started to dabble into drugs  and the “party life”. Once he started doing that, I kind of distanced myself because I didn’t know how to react. I was kind of mad but also sad so I didn’t really talk to him as much. Fast forward to now, I talk to him more but I don’t know if it will ever be the same. He is always talking about trying new drugs and doing all this stuff at parties which tbh I don’t really care for. Should I still attempt to have that relationship we once had? I still care for him but it’s so hard to listen and be there for him when he’s putting himself in dangerous situations. If I stop being friends with him, does that make me a bad friend for not sticking through it? Should I stay friends to try and make a positive environment? HELP ‪",ND
50,"Eating your friend's food
Hi
I'm curious about something.
I always have something to eat in my backpack (chocolate, candies etc.).
And I have this friend, who's often hungry and didn't bring any food with her. I have offered my chocolate to her may times . What I can't understand is, that she always takes soooo much. She sometimes even eats all of my chocolate or snacks. It's not that I have problems with it. For me, such a behavior is a lil bit impolite. I'm asking myself, if is it normal to eat all of your friends snack or take so much of it without asking if you can do it?

51,"New friends
Hi,

I’m new here. I have a huge problem. 
It’s extremely hard for me to trust people I have a bond with (friends). Out of fear of rejection or disapproval for my actions, I don’t dare to become closer. I fear people will leave me eventually, so the idea that I have friends, isn’t present. When it is present, I feel like I need to stay in touch very often. 
I feel reluctant to take initiative often. If I don’t get asked for something, it’s a strong sign I’m not wanted. This has become standardized.
I have some vague friends, but they live far away. We can’t that close, don’t share many interests, but we like each other. We can’t meet up often. 

What can I do to find new friends and do regularly something in my neighborhood. I’m close to a city, but I live in a village. I’m all day home (except for school and such), don’t feel energized to take action. Sigh. 
Getting advice like ‘find a sport, hobby, club’ doesn’t help much, I get suck. 
I feel like I don’t have even insight in the process of making friends. Or I’m not wanted. I feel like something is going wrong every time, but I don’t know what.

I married my current husband on Sept 1, 2017. On 10/6/17 he lost his job. Now I feel as if I'm back where I started. I have to pay for everything. On top of it, he invited his 18-year-old daughter to move in with us without asking me, even though I'm paying for everything. Suddenly I'm paying for her groceries and everything else on top of his. Then, I'm informed by my husband that his daughter's boyfriend is going to spend every weekend here: Friday night through Sunday afternoon. Now I'm feeding him too. To make matters worse, the daughter and her boyfriend are loud and inconsiderate. They leave messes in the kitchen, living room, her room, etc. I miss my quiet house. Paying for him and I is more than enough. Am I selfish to not want to support her and her boyfriend too? I have a house in a different city but he refused to move there because my young adult kids live there. So I have to pay for 2 households because he refuses to move there, yet I have to live with his daughter. I'm about ready to run back home to my other house and call this quits.

I'm not sure how to feel. My sisters and I are fairly close, and I'm worried that we won't be able to bond with our new sibling because of the huge age difference. We'll probably have all moved out in a few years (I've been planning on moving out this year) so we won't even get to have time to make those connections like we did with each other.

62,"Having to share a small living space with Grandpa
My grandpa and I are having trouble adjusting to our new living situation, and I was wondering if anyone had any ideas to help us in this predicament.

Backstory:

I never really saw eye to eye with him while growing up. He was quite the wild prankster, and his antics often left me humiliated and embarrassed. Back in my boyhood of 1991, he pantsed me while I performed at the school talent show. He routinely mentions this while at family gatherings, and it has subsequently caused me extreme grief. This trend of surprise humiliation lasted for two decades. Just when I thought me and gramps were cool again, I'd feel my pants hit the ground. He's  deprived me of my sanity, as well as given me an extreme fear of public speaking scenarios. I ended up forcing him to go to family counseling with me, and he denied the whole thing. After turning in historical footage (my mom always cam-corded my recitals or graduation ceremonies), he finally gave in and admitted to his rude behavior. It took a couple dozen sessions, ending with a mock-talent-show, where I played my trumpet for the therapist. Gramps just sat there, cool as ice. With arms folded, he nodded to me - and that's where things changed.

Anyhow, I had an extra ticket to go see Teagan and Sara - so I got ol' gramps on the phone. He kinda razzed me for listening to such feminine sounding music, but eventually accepted my invitation. I picked him up and brought him to the venue. The ticket office said there was a mixup, and that we'd get front-row seats. This was my lucky day, as well as a great way to finally bond with the old codger. 

It took a couple of songs, but he really got into it. He was so exuberant, jumping up and down on his seat. He pulled me up, and I did the same. After the first half of the set wrapped up, the sisters on stage looked down at gramps and I. They asked us if we were having a good time, and also the nature of our relation. A stage hand passed down a microphone to gramps. 

""I'm here with my grandson!""

There was this big 'awwww' that came from the crowd. They asked us how long he'd been a fan, and he mentioned the fact that I would sometimes play their songs on my trumpet. To my amazement, they pulled me and gramps on stage for the next song. They got me a trumpet and instructed me to play a solo to ""I was a fool"" - It was literally one of the best moments of my life. I was on stage with my favorite sister duet band.

Right as I put the brass mouthpiece to my lips, I felt those wrinkly little fingers jutting into my belt loops. I tried to stop him, but my pants hit the ground before I could react. I wanted to die in that moment. Security ended up escorting us out of the venue, where a police officer was waiting for us.

Now we're both cell mates for the next year. We got caught in some type of legal double-whammy. He, being the pantser, was ruled guilty for sexual assault. Me, the pants-ee, was convicted of exposure and indecency. Both of us will have to register as sex offenders once we're out of the clink. 

Anyhow - I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on how we could pass the time together? Any board games or things like that? We have a whole year of time to kill, and it really took being cellmates for me to understand exactly how generation gapped we are. Anyhow, your advice is greatly appreciated. I gotta hide this phone, but I'll check for your replies later tonight.

72,"Why is it that I forget information about certain people?

Today, I've asked one of my female coworkers about what degree is she going for even though I keep asking that question when I forgot. She told me she's going for a dental bachelor. I've brought up that I've brought this up a bunch of times and she nodded.  I felt pretty embarrassed for asking that question and forgetting the answer a lot of times. (She isn't the only one though)

I think the reason why I forget is because the front end has a tendency to have its employees to have erratic working schedules thus it doesn't help when some of the employees go to college on their days off.  I'm twenty five year old woman who doesn't go to college because I'm not too wild about school. 

I know a little bit about some of my coworkers, but I don't hang out with them outside the workplace because of many reasons. 

1.) I don't always to make the effort to build a relationship with them because I don't have a lot to say except for questions such how's your day, what time are you working til, and anything new.  I will speak when I'm spoken to.

2.) I'm usually inside my head thinking a lot. 

3.) I look for people with similar interests. (video games, animation, internet, vaporwave, and so forth on)

4.) I usually wait until someone talks to me.

5.) I don't open up to people easily.

6.) My social life is spent more online.

7.) The interests I have aren't mainstream (video games seem to be somewhat mainstream these days)

8.) I have autism while most of the employees don't have autism. 

9.) I don't drive due to my fear of disability limiting my ability to drive safety.

10.) I don't talk a lot about my interests because I'm afraid I may obsess over them over and over again due to the point it may annoy co workers.

11.) I don't usually get involved with conversations with co workers because I need to focus on my job.

12.) When the time gets busy, I normally don't talk a lot. Again, I need focus on the job. 

13.) I come from a solitary family from my mother's side. (introversion)

14.) I have a fear that I may say something that may offend them.

15.) I don't always have the motivation to socialize.

16.) I don't talk about my social life with family for reasons.

17.) I come across as serious, thus it doesn't help that I take a lot of things seriously


I'm currently looking for free volunteer drivers in my area so I could get to places and make and keep friends.  Thankfully, I have someone at home to take me to work, but not always available to take me. Thus I can get to work by walking. (My town is somewhat walk-able)

Back to retaining some information about co workers, I remember them I like some of the facts about them. I will put the first letter of my names of the co workers for privacy.

Example: B is  big on cats, she has an eighteen year old daughter who used to have a pet bunny long time ago. 
She also love chinese as much as I do. 

C loves to play video games just like I do.  He doesn't like the customer is always right policy.


I have a fifteen minute break for every five hours I work. The breakroom tends to vary with there's no people to there's lots of people.

Some of the co workers I know use their phone to browse on the internet while eating, and I don't want to bother them while they browse on their phone. Let's face it, it's getting tougher to socialize in real life when internet's taking over everyday life. 

TL;DR I'd like to know why I lose track of facts of particular co workers and what could I do about it.",ND

74,"How to enjoy my father
My father is 70, and a heavy smoker. He is healthy NOW, and still sane, but smoking is slowly deteriorating my father. I am only 16, my life is very busy, I go to school, come home, eat, sit in my room and work on my fast growing business, then sleep.

I hate being away but I HAVE TO! There is so much stuff that needs to be done toward my business, I don’t even have friends etc. I really want to spend time with my dad before it’s too late. I don’t wanna regret this.

What should I do to be able to get closer to my dad?",ND
75,"Friends That Can’t Be Wrong?
So basically; my friend always thinks that I’m mad when I’m not. In turn, he gets mad at me because I’m “mad”. I try to explain as calmly as possible that I’m not mad, which makes him even more mad.

Why does he always convince himself that I’m mad and refuse to understand that I’m not even when I try to explain it?

How can I handle situations like this? He’s a cool dude and all but his mislead belief in thinking I’m mad and refusing to accept that I’m not mad, in turn, makes me mad. It’s so annoying.",ND
76,"Relationship with my Dad
Hey, I post this as I need help on how to deal with the situation on my relationship with my Dad. Don't get me wrong, I do love him- however I am not sure that I like him to the extent that he likes me. By like, I mean as a ""buddy"" relationship, we have similar interests and we talk about these interests a lot, but his personality irritates me and we have gotten in a lot of arguments, of which I never convince him.

I am currently in University, I am living on campus (this is the first time living on my own), and I must say: I am absolutely loving it. Having my first time being independent has made me feel much better. Mainly because I am away from home. I have this thing where I just want to be independent, not influenced by other people's views/thoughts (my Dad mainly). A couple of years ago my Mum and Dad broke up, I stayed with my Dad as I did not agree with what my Mum had done. Me and my Dad were always close as we are both into Gaming and watching TV shows etc... but it is only recently that I have realized I dislike him. 

My Dad can be quick at losing his temper, he lives by the policy of Honesty (which is a good trait), but at the same time- he is completely contradicting. In arguments we get into, I explain my view and so does he, however he turns my view against me and then later apoligises for not understanding, making sure he will listen better in future. This never happens. This has persisted over the years and it makes me feel uneasy talking to him about anything. I then feel guilty about not wanting to talk to him. Which brings me to my next issue.

He talks to me daily. Once in morning, some points during the day and then at night. I understand this is his first time living alone too, but I need my space and it is physically and mentally draining having to talk to him. Especially as I feel forced to keep the conversation going. Pretty much the majority of the conversation is me talking about my day, my thoughts on things and anything interesting that happened. He briefly mentions his stuff, but then there is silence. I try to keep the conversation flowing, but it does NOT feel natural at all. It is not like the conversations I have with my friends or other members of the family. Which again, makes me feel guilty when I want to hang up. I really have tried to change my perspective. 

It is getting close to moving back home (I am a first year student) and will be commuting from my home town to University for the upcoming years at Uni. I am really not looking forward to this. I am enjoying spending time AWAY from home, to avoid my Dad. Now I am going to have to live with him for the next few years. 

Now I do love him, and he does everything for me. He is trying to pay off my Student loans so I feel comfortable, and I have been saving for my deposit that I will put on a house after my time at Uni. But the issue is, I really want independence. I feel guilty that I want to live in the city where my Uni is and work to pay joint rent with friends. This way I learn the world of work, but that comes with having higher stress as I'd have to work and study. Which is what my dad doesn't agree with. And trying to explain to him that I want to learn the world of work does not compute with him. As rationally speaking, there are many more benefits of me commuting. And I cannot win, I really can't. He wants me to get the best oppotunity I can in life, and make sure that I get my Masters. But, he is deciding and forcing my path for me. I feel restricted and it makes me feel down most days for each time I have to talk to him. It just reminds me of the next 3 years being stuck at home with him, him thinking we have this great relationship where I just prefer literally anything else. 

Thank you.",ND
77,"Friends keep making fun of me?
Firstly, I'm 18 and attending high school right now.Recently, my parents got us a dog, and we named it Carly. I freaking loved her, but after reviewing some medical expenses we would have to pay, we had to give her back to her shelter after only a month or so of having her. I was heartbroken.

I came back to school on Monday this week and told my friends. Now in my friend group of three, there is one guy who loves to make fun of us. One of my friends is fat so he makes fun of his weight. I'm gay and he makes fun of me for being a faggot. My other friend does weed and he makes fun of him for being a drug junkie.

But I think he crossed the line this time. He made fun of me by saying ""you killed your dog"" and all he's been doing this week has been calling me a ""dog killer"" and telling everyone that I am one. The annoying part is my best friend in the group is tagging along with this joke and they both think it's okay to make fun of me for this.

I'm kind of embarrassed to say this, but I'm a very emotional person and I suffer from depression so it's hard for me to deal with this kind of stuff. Today when they started making fun of me again for being a ""dog killer"" I left and hid in the bathroom cause I just wanted to cry and I did. I hate it when people are mean to each other and it really hurts when someone does it to me. That, and the fact I was really sad about Carly leaving me makes me just not want to talk to them anymore. But the problem is those guys are the only friends I really have (Trust me, they remind me I'd have no friends if they weren't so nice to be my friend).

I really don't know what to do. I miss my dog, I've been really depressed as of recently, and my friends are making fun of me. What should I do about my friends, honestly? Because I know if I tell them ""guys stop making fun of me, I didn't kill my dog"" they'd without a doubt say something like ""that's exactly what a dog killer would say!"". I've never been able to reason with them whenever they make fun of me.

Can anyone help me?",ND
78,"Will my best friend come back because of this reason?
In about April my best friend cut me off from her life, we were friends for nearly 7 months and we were so close, had a really strong bond, and the only time we wouldn't talk to eachother whether it'd be facetime, messenger or call as well as trying to see eachother as often as possible, was when we would sleep. Otherwise, we were always talking to eachother and we cared for and loved eachother a great deal and did heaps for eachother but yeh she did in fact cut me off because I didn't reply to her messages one day. Anyway we haven't communicated at all since then but I sent her a letter for this year 12 camp we did so it's a graduation letter dedicated to her. I told her I would send it to her when we were friends and I'm not sure if she's forgotten but it is going to be sent to her. The contents of it go along the lines of thanking her, stating how much I appreciate her and that I'll always be there for her no matter the situation in 1 1/2 pages.

I was very supportive and told him I was proud of him, but I'm not sure if he remembers having this conversation. He made sure to say multiple times that this is something he would want to talk about sober, but I'm worried that might have just been the alcohol talking. The topic hasn't come up since. I'm not sure if I should bring it up. I don't want to embarrass him or force him to come back out if he doesn't remember it, but I also am worried that he may remember it and be to embarrassed to bring it up himself.

80,"Should I let my brother live with us?
Not sure if this is the right place or if another sub is better, but here goes. I have a brother, 29, turning 30 this year, who lives with my parents. My parents sold their house and have not yet decided where to live. They are 65 and 70 and are retired. We own a small apartment building and live in it and rent the units. My parents will have some cash and also have monthly income, but my brother appears to be very depressed, may also have some untreated medical issues, and is a sober alcoholic who may be abusing prescription drugs (not pain pills, but Xanax &amp; Ativan? Not sure). He seems to sleep all day and rarely goes to his job, which is doing over other people's houses as a contractor. He owns his own truck and tools. My parents are worried they'll ""lose"" him when they move if he doesn't move with them, but nobody knows what to do or what his real problem(s) are.

Is it a stupid idea for us to just have everyone live in our building and subsidize my brother's ""rent"" by having him pay some nominal amount subject to regular psychiatry and/or other requirements? Has anyone done this? Is there another sub that is better for these types of questions? I don't know if anyone knows what to do anymore. My mom enables him but is finally making an appointment for him to see an internist, though he is very manipulative and secretive so I don't know what to do or if anything else can be done and I am somewhat concerned he will manipulate the internist--he's very deceptive. I don't even know if there's a name for what he does.",ND
81,"How to drift away from a 'best friend' you don't like anymore?
I have a friend, and I am trying to put distance between us. They're generally a nice person (but do some mean things occasionally), but they're quite... boring. Okay, very boring. I don't even know how I have been able to put up with the lack of interesting conversation for the past 2 years. I need a best friend with whom I can laugh about fun stuff and not just talk about SCHOOL. 

Let's call them B. 

B has clung to me for the past 2 years, so they don't have any other friends. I have loads of other friends, but they all assume that I'm best friends with B, so they don't make an effort to include me in their friendship group. I've told quite a few of them, and they are giving me some advice on what to do, but I want to see what all of you say. 

For the past few weeks, I have been making it quite clear that I don't really want to talk to B. I give them short answers as replies, don't make eye contact or initiate conversations and I have generally been ignoring them. I know it sounds mean, but I've had enough. I can't deal with clingy people. However, B is either EXTREMELY OBLIVIOUS, or they are just being really stubborn. 

Also, even though I am ignoring B, I sit next to them in lots of lessons, and I also hang out in the same room as them at break and lunch so they always come and shuffle next to me! SO. INFURIATING. I don't want to change rooms, because then I won't be with my friends. 

Another thing is that if I ignore B, I actually look like a loner. I ignore them by being antisocial in the corner doing my homework most of the time. I mean, everyone in my school already thinks I'm sort of weird child that studies all of the time, because I always seem to be studying at school (which is actually because I don't do anything at home). I also have to eat by myself at lunch, and having social anxiety definitely doesn't help with that. I know I shouldn't care about that, but it's hard not to. 

I went off on a tangent there, didn't I?

So basically, what I'm trying to ask you is that should I completely completely ignore B (e.g. don't talk to them at all) or is that too mean? (Please don't suggest anything that says to try and be friends with them, because I don't want to do that. I want to make exciting friendships that I will remember, and not be stuck with... a boring person. Also, I'm 14. I don't know if that will help, but meh.)

B has turned into one of those people that... you just want to punch in the face for no reason. Do you sort of get what I mean?

84,"Money and power are your friend, not human beings!
I am cynical about friendship from my recent experience. 

I am from a well-off family but I’d tried to live by my own and lived in a very tiny studio. To my well-off friends, I might look humble. They partied, traveled, and dined together without me, and kept those in secret (some of those events were blurted by mutual friends). Especially one of them frequently ignored me. When I really needed someone in order to be discharged from a hospital, that person didn’t help me even though she could - she didn’t even hide it. 

My parents didn’t like me living in a small place rent, so they bought me a very nice condo. Those well-off friends learned this news and they were excited about it. The woman who’d been ignoring me and hadn’t helped me out, volunteered to help my moving. I refused. When I had a house warming with them, they saw my place and was anxious to be invited to any of my future parties at this new place (yes, it’s a really nice place.)

And then, they started to invite me to their exclusive parties and dining gatherings. They even asked me why I put some distance from them. It was ridiculous. Why did you guys act like you’d been caring about me so much? 

Life has taught me that my true friends are money and power, not human beings. ",ND
85,"Advice Please
I've been in a relationship with a woman for some time now, and it's becoming serious enough that marriage is a certainty. She has a son from her previous marriage, seven years old. Her previous husband, however, was very controlling and abusive. Her son has a lot of behaviour issues as a result. He constantly swears (""fuck, shit, cunt, etc"", just to show how extreme), he's violent a lot, throwing things across the room, he's constantly screaming and shouting, no concept of manners. He'll shout ""give me food now"". His mother, as a result of the cruel treatment she got from her husband, is too scared to stand up to him. He clearly has anger issues bordering on clinical. He'll often have breakdowns with fits of anger.

She lives with her parents. While they have the best of intentions for their grandson, her mothers treatment of her is vile. She's cruel and demeaning. She constantly undermines her confidence and authority, saying she's stupid and doesn't know what she's doing in front of her son, and then, stupidly, complains that she get her son to listen to her. She regularly swears. She loudly gossips about everybody, complaining about with violent undertones. And to make it worse, she often threatens calling social services on her. Personally, I doubt she would, as she got far more incriminating evidence against her than her daughter. But either way, he would be taken from both of them.

So, yeah..... a bit complicated. No idea what to do. As it's very likely that I'll become a step father to this child, I was wondering what advice people could give, or direct me to somewhere that could help. Thanks",ND

87,"Dealing with a spiteful sister-in-law?
I'm 28, and we are all living under the same roof. I live with my mom and dad, and help take care of my grandparents.. I have fibromyalgia, chronic pain, migraines 4-5 times a week and have trouble getting out of bed some days. Brother (loses jobs frequently, can never keep his wife happy) she's become a very spiteful and distant person in the last 2 years. They decided to move in March of 2016 after not getting their way of getting help from my mom (who helps everyone and is the kindest and most selfless person you will ever meet). They have 3 kids, and now a fourth one on the way in May. Brother ""Dave"" and his wife gonna call her ""Vick"". Always go back and forth at one another, as he loses jobs and they both work (she's held a stable job and he hasn't), calls him lazy, P.O.S., a horrible father, our family made her the way she is now, tells her kids to ""suck it or, or stop crying"" when they get upset or hurt. She used to be the sweetest, kindest person ever. I REALLY liked this woman, and we got along great. I could never say a bad thing about her 10 years ago. Until, I came out in 2008 as gay. She was supportive or so I thought. Then wrote a long nasty letter to me after telling my mom she didn't want me holding my boyfriends hand around her kids, that she didn't want that exposed to them, etc. I called her a hypocrite and walked off, because she did all these things with her husband and more. Nothing more, nothing less.  Cause she was and I was sick of all her bull about me and her hating on the way I was. I don't say things unless something truly bothers me and I was at the last straw. 


Said she didn't support me being gay, me being with my boyfriend was wrong, she doesn't want her kids around it, etc. Anyway, little bits of this kept coming up over the last 9 years and slowly grew distant from her. Last one me being worried about her being mad at me for something, as she came in and didn't talk  to me or respond to what I had said. I said is she mad at me? To my brother. He goes I don't think so. She then yells ""I'm not mad, STOP BEING SO DRAMATIC!"" I'm like wow.. completely out of character for her. I've never done anything to her to get spoken to like this.  1 year ago -- she called my brother a piece of sh*t for the 40th time. I got tired of it, her belittling him, throwing his things, telling him that our family are horrible people for the fights we get in once every 2 months. He looked defeated, he looked the saddest I've ever seen him. I asked what was wrong, he told me. I agreed with what he had said about her letting the children use the tablets too, that it was ridiculous that she's called him something so horrible over it. I was really angry at her, disappointed with her. We had gotten into a big fight after me coming out before as well and she denied everything that happened that day. 


I whipped out my phone for this one -- so all the facts were here. Everything was caught on camera for the minute we got into it. After I go into my room, she comes and slams the door next to my room closed and says, ""You've got to me f'ing kidding me. Is he really siding with you. HELL NO!"" to my brother. I come out and say what's the problem? (My mistake, but no... no one in my family has ever said anything to this woman to keep the peace. They're afraid of her taking the grandchildren away and my mom loves them dearly and is afraid of having a bad relationship with her.) I say ""I'm tired of you calling my brother a piece of crap."" I yelled, ""Stop treating him like that, what the hell is wrong with you? Who says that to the person they love and are married to? Why do you belittle him so much when he's finally got a nice job. I can't believe anyone in this house doesn't say anything to you over the way you treat him, specially around your kids. You say we're saying bad words in front of them and you guys and making you this way, analyze yourself."" 


She tells then to ""go back to your room, get a frigging job."" Then turns to my brother and says ""do something with your brother, go back to your room!""""I say no, you don't like what I have to say (and I speak for everyone in this house cause it's true). You can go."" This sparks her sister to message me -- telling me ""Never in my life have I been so disgusted with someone. Who do you think you are filming her!? The mother of your nephew and nieces raising your voice at her telling her to get out. I'm so disgusted, get the F' outta here!"" 


Brother wouldn't defend her after that happened. She went to my mom (who's like best friends with her) -- she didn't defend her. She then split with him for 8 months (this last August) that day. Now they're back together. Saying they're going to move and haven't. Ever since then, she's just been passive aggressive. Stands in the doorway and doesn't move when I need to get through. Is constantly rude when anyone says anything to her kids (when they're making a mess, yelling and telling adults to stop talking to them) unattended downstairs as she's on the couch upstairs. Telling my brother that I'm doing things when I haven't even spoken to this woman in months. I am so uncomfortable around her. I have said hi to her and things and have stopped, because it's a short ""hi"" and walks by. The last 6 months she's walked by me and hasn't said a word, no hi, no bye when she goes out the door. Walks by me or anyone in this house aside from my mom like we're not there.

I know this sounds pathetic coming from a man who's 28, but I'm actually sick and am developing actual dislike and almost even hate for this woman. She hogs the washer and dryer, tells me to turn my animal light off when she's going to bed (cause it's out where she sleeps in the upstairs loft). Tells me to get all my stuff out of there when it was my storage space and now my room is packed with all my things out there. Tells everyone to keep it down. You go down the stairs too loud (passed her) she will ask who's there and make a big deal out of it. If anyone says anything to their daughters being rude to us, they both snap (yes my brother too) and call us rude, guilt trip us and say ""they're 5 and 9 years old, this is the way youre going to talk to a kid!?!, or they were just trying to make a sandwich as they're telling us to ""stop taking to me or telling me what to do, you're not my mom or dad"" etc.

Is it bad that I want them all to move? I'm in my room most days when they're. I feel so trapped here, and I don't know what to do. I have no choice but to stay here until I find a job for people like me with chronic health issues - and they're never going to move because they constantly mooch off my mother.  She pays for their car accidents, their bills, their car rentals, their groceries, dinner, gives them money to go on dates and gas to go drive to work (even though they make their own money), etc.  My mom is starting to sort of agree she even wants them to move, and she won't step up and say anything to anyone. I tell her to or else I will. She goes ""NO DON'T!"" She's so afraid of these people -- and losing her grandkids. 

I don't know what to do.",ND

Hello. I am not sure whether this fits in this sub but I am going to ask it anyway. My family is a known gossiper. All of them tend to gossip about me. I am the odd ball, the one who doesn't agree with them. The one they all tend to chat about. Many times we have arguments, they all gain up on me. I will have my mom, dad, and older sisters all attacking my character- telling me I am no good and that I am poison . I have caught them in a few instances; but they brush it off. Often, they pretend I am being paranoid or they play dumb and be like, ""I did nothing, we said nothing."" Sometimes they complain about someone else to use it to get to me. It's really bothersome. It makes me feel so betrayed, confused, and really angered. I also not my family learns things about me before I even told them- mainly negative. There are lists of inconsistent gaps. I try to confront them but they immediately dismiss me. They try to cover up their tracks and always tell me I am paranoid. I know lots of the advice will be to confront them, but I do not believe that will work. I have tried that- all kinds of approaches but they insist they did nothing even when I catch them saying things about me. My mother does it the most. Often she, gossips after work with my sisters or sometimes with my dad. Sometimes my sisters gossip about me together. I have become the play thing in the family- my problems and life is just a giant joke they can share their contempt for. It's hurts. It's hard not to give a shot because it's your own family. I have considered audio recording secretly but that is creepy and invades their privacy despite they do that with me often. It's also wrong to play the same game. What should I do?

My friend is a guy.
It seems like he wants to be oppressed so badly. It’s kinda funny but mostly insulting. 

A few nights ago he was telling me that he was bi-racial (mix of two races, would happen if Mom and dad were different races) even though both of his parents are white af and he isn’t adopted. 

He told me he has autism and was disabled even though he exhibits 0 autistic traits and I know he hasn’t been diagnosed. When I ask him what his disability is, he always gives shady or different answers. 

He keeps saying he has schizophrenia but when I ask, he is always like “what? ...... oh yea” like he needs to be reminded about an illness that is supposed to seriously impact his life.

He keeps telling me he is gay but after a little drinking he tells be about a girl he has a crush on.

I have a small tight knit group of friends, 6 of us total, who have been friends since early high school years (so about 10/15 years at least). 
Everybody has their annoying qualities but one of our friends tends to annoy every one of us at different points. This has never changed our friendship. 
Recently, 4 of them have decided that we should make plans without the “annoying one”. They have begun a group text about plans for hanging out which don’t include her just because they don’t know if they can handle her.
I love my friends but I feel this is absolutely horrible to do behind someone’s back, especially someone who they’ve been friends with for so long. I would be devastated if they did that to me and I have a feeling she will find out one way or another. Because of that, I don’t want to be in the discussion with them at all and won’t attend any event they plan in such a sneaky way.

He drives himself around, works, volunteers, has a long distance relationship. He just seems to be a bit upset and nervous about the state of my life. Like I'm always complaining and yammering about something and it's hard on him. Yet all he wants to do is help me, so he keeps trying, and every time, he just gets put through the ringer and it's hard on him. I feel so bad because I say very harsh things and he's such a fragile person, trying so hard to be tough in this world. And I know shocking the system when you're old is hard on you. So I'm trying to just be mature, put all of the mess behind me, and ensure evevery time him and I are together now, he can see that I'm all good, grown up, and not going to make everything bad for him again. I just want 65 onwards for him and us to be quality bonding time. ",ND
93,"I can't forgive her, no matter how hard I try
I'm focusing on improving myself and working through repressed emotions from a difficult upbringing, namely with my grandmother. I am currently staying with her but thankfully I am already making plans and taking steps to move out within the next 5 months or so. I have stayed on and off the last several years and before I became an adult, I lived with her from birth.

We have a complicated relationship. Although I appreciate the things she has done for me - and she often tries to make me happy by buying me something or getting me food I like, etc. - I can't seem to let go of the deep seated anger and resentment I feel toward her for the mistakes she has made and how she has also been cruel to me.

I understand no one is perfect; adults aren't always ideal role models to kids. But my grandmother had a unique way of mentally and emotionally hurting me as a child. She would often act like I was her partner in crime [in the absence of a husband] and made me feel responsible for her happiness. She would try to talk bad about my mom so I wouldn't favor her [my mom wasn't living with us and had mental issues]. She would give me the cold shoulder, or say things to incite anxiety and guilt in me if I happened to act like I wanted to spend more time with my mom or got in a bad mood. 

It confuses me because I think deep in my heart I DO want a happy relationship with her...or maybe I try so hard out of guilt, knowing she has tried to make it up to me, I guess? But every so often I implode and I tell her how much she bothers me or even that I hate her. Sometimes even hearing the sound of her voice is enough to make me want to scream in irritation. I feel terrible about it and like I'm a monster. I always feel guilty when she tells me 'you're the only one who is really special to me, you're the only one I have.' [She doesn't have a close relationship with mom, her other D, or siblings.] Maybe I get angry because to me, this doesn't feel normal, it feels like I'm being trapped. 

I'm seeing a DBT therapist but we aren't making progress about this ... yet. I just wish this was not my life. I'm not looking for solutions per say, just sympathy or someone who also understands. It's so exhausting. ",ND
94,"Friend leads much better life, I feel resentful
We both just graduated, she had so many job offers,  I had none save for an internship. I found a job later but I make less than half of what she makes. She got a job offer from another firm, and referred me to them when she turned them down, but I didn't get it even though the interview went great. And because she makes so much more than I do, she's always trying to get me to travel, which I can't afford since I'm saving up for grad school.  She's also currently in a relationship, and has tried to set me up with people but it never works. 

She's a great friend but she makes me feel so inadequate. I'm begining to become resentful and envious, and I don't want to be a toxic person to be around. It's getting hard for me to hear about her achievements while I have nothing to compare, how shitty of a person would I be if I distanced myself from her for my own mental well-being? ",ND
95,"Was it wrong to block my dad's phone?
Was it wrong of me to block my dad? We had a massive fight that just escalated quickly, as we always do. My dad has a habit to threaten to disown me every time he gets angry. Once I pointed out how hurtful it was, and asked him to please not to say that, but nothing changed. So I’m just trying not to respond to these angry text messages about how he wanted me to stop using their address because we are not family anymore. 20 minutes later he sends another message telling me to do as he says or he will embarrass me in an extended family group chat (he doesn’t know that it doesn’t bother me and he eventually carries out this threat later), and then 20 minutes later he offers me a deal where he would drop this address issue if I do a couple of things that he wanted. Sorry for being vague, the things he wanted were the things I essentially didn’t want to do and is linked to what we had an argument about. From my perspective, I saw messages that were intentionally hurtful, about how I wasn’t family, and then I saw a threat to shame me, and then I saw what looks like a way to manipulate or coerce me into doing what he wanted. It was very late at night and I had work the next day. That was the point I blocked his number (and I told him before I blocked it) and it is the first time ever in all 30 years of my life. However, now I’m wondering if it was the right thing to do, because well, Asian parents always say shit like that and don’t mean it, and I think my very drastic step would have upset both my parents a lot. An imposed silence also sabotages the opportunity for future open communication and is quite passive aggressive as well. If they were overreacting about the disowning me part, then I could have angered them to the point where they decide to go through with it.

The next two days I unblocked my dad and sent some messages about how I was sorry I had to block my dad and clarified some of the things they were unhappy about (some of what they were unhappy about wasn't at all true). But I think both my parents have now blocked my number. Yet I can't blame them for doing that because I did it to them first, but I do wish I had just turned off my mobile, or been able to bear the burden of hearing shitty talk, instead of blocking my dad. (It's not possible to visit them as we live in different countries).  

Prior to this fight, I have been working through ‘abandonment’ issues with a therapist. Not hard to understand why… my dad always says things like ‘don’t call me dad’ and ‘don’t come home’, ‘don’t need a daughter like that’ if I don’t do what he says for as long as I can remember. My parents don't know this. I’ve thought about completely cutting my dad out of my life, but I’m undecided as I feel like other people who have done it have more serious issues like abuse, violence, lying, and more about conflicts on serious issues like marriage, religion, sexual identity and child custody.

Would really appreciate some 'Asian' perspective here, as most of my friends don't fully understand the cultural aspect of this.

96,"Letter To Dad - Christian Fatherhood
Author Kent Nerburn once wrote, “It is much easier to become a father than to be one.” This rings true, even for those men who really want to be a father. With enough hard work and determination we can master a career, a hobby, or a sport but it is difficult to even control anything in fatherhood, let alone master it. When the baby starts crying, how do we make her stop? When our son starts failing classes in school, how do you motivate him and help him with both the drive and the subject matter? Fatherhood is slow and daunting work.

Ok so all throughout high school (I graduated high school 4 years ago) I had a best friend. We were sisters literally thought we would be friends forever. We graduated I got into my first relationship and we drifted apart and she never really let me know how she felt. She told me one day she wishes I would stop talking about him so much and that kind of was like ok cool that kind of sucks but not a big deal. Being in my first relationship that I’m currently still in it sucked not being able to talk about it because I was so excited. Anyways months passed and we got into an argument and basically we ended our friendship because she thought I was an awful friend because I was too busy for her. Fast forward a year after that we started talking again (I reached out, I always do) we started being “friends” again but it felt so awkward. Honestly though she’s the only one who was ever angry and made things not feel the same. On her 21st birthday she invited everyone to her party at her house but me and told me it was because we didn’t talk much and she didn’t want awkward vibes at her house. After that I just unfollowed her on social media and we didn’t talk at all. I messaged her over the summer congratulating her to see she was taking a trip to China and then she messaged me on my birthday. This all happened in 2017 so our friendship has been fucked up for like 2 years now. Because I deleted her number a while ago I decided to reach out and talk to her on Instagram saying happy birthday and hope she was doing well and she never replied and I know she saw it. So our friendship is dead. I’ve known it’s been dead too for like 2 years now but how do I stop being so damn hurt? I think it hurts even more because she truly doesn’t give a fuck and she was my best friend ever. I wish I could go back and do something else to fix it. Idk lately I’ve cried so much. I haven’t been able to find a good friend like her again even though she wasn’t THAT great. How can I stop obsessing over our friendship and just let it go? I constantly look at her Instagram to see how she’s doing and it just really sucks. :( ",ND
99,"relationship with sister falling apart, different memories, need advice
Hi,

In a nutshell - my sister (both about 30years old) has been accusing me of saying various horrible/bad things, often saying I said it seconds ago, sometimes hours ago and getting angry with me.

I don't think I've been saying these things.

It's really wearing me down, either I am being horrible and forgetting, or she is (perhaps unknowingly) making it up.

I've recently said I'm going to record some of our conversations to see if I can prove my innocence, or find out I have an issue with my memory/attitude and get help.

This has gone down very badly, she now insists I don't speak to her for at least as long as I may record her.

What do I do? My goal is for my family to get along well, or at least OK - but I have no idea what I can do to fix things or make them better.

Any thoughts or advice is more than welcome

103,"How do I reconcile with a failed friendship from the past
Earlier this year, I met a Colombian woman in my state and failed at my attempts to date her; many of our disagreements surrounded my personal history of morbid obesity.  Although I am 5'9'' and now weight around 240 lbs, I have weighed nearly 400 lbs as a teenager and young adult.

We dined together and talked to each other for around two weeks.  Within that timeframe, I became very disaffected by her constant criticisms of other men she dated, such as her issues with their hygiene, lack of direction, etc.  After talking to her nearly everyday, she suddenly asked me ""Do you think we're dating?... I think we can only be friends.""  I immediately parted ways with her, informed her of my thoughts on her demanding and emotionally draining ways, very bluntly told her that I didn't like her, and directed her to no longer communicate with me.

After another two weeks, she texted me out of the blue and said she ""understood"" my anger, asked to reconnect saying that she though I was a ""beautiful"" person, and eventually informed me that her ""biggest concern was my weight.""  After another month, we went out (with me spending money for gas, etc.) and explored multiple regions in my state.  She kept encouraging me to lose weight and gave me a diet book.  Within the last times we spoke, she confided in me that she was an undocumented immigrant and told me - in anguished tears - about a failed marriage here in the U.S., as well as unwanted sexual encounters she faced here.   I offered my help, but she declined any of my attempts to reconcile her immigration status.  After another week, I became very depressed about not meeting specific weight targets.  I eventually broke down, said I felt ""less than human,"" and asked if we could postpone any further in-person meetings until I could lose enough weight.  Over the weekend, she ignored my texts; I drove to her home to see if she was okay and noticed her car was parked outside.

She eventually texted me, saying that I was a person with ""unfriendly attitudes"" sometimes.  Later in the day, she told me that hearing me talk of my weight was tiring.  I was so baffled I couldn't get out a response.  After that, she told me that  I am ""too sensitive,"" looked at the criticism as an insult, and then mockingly told me ""everything hurts you, everything affects you.""  I told her that ignoring me was inherently wrong and hung up.  She then gave me a long text ending that I should ""just be happy... happiness isn't just about body image.""  

I need advice on how to handle situations like this.  My gut reaction was to tell her she was a ""selfish bitch"" and hang up the phone.  Looking back, that's probably what I needed to do, because that's exactly what I was thinking at the time.

Secondly, I need to really reevaluate a relationship with a therapist who told me that cutting her off the first time I did was the wrong thing to do.   I am holding a serious grudge against him, particularly as I don't trust him anymore.

In sum, I am unhappy in life - because of shit like this.  I try to be a good person and deal with human turds.  But I need to be strong enough to break out of it rather than be a victim.",ND
104,"Is there any chance of me being able to fix the friendship?
Hello all,

Needing some advice on how to fix this friendship, or even if I should.

So, I met this girl at a club, and before I knew it, we became great friends. She would come round my place all the time. We would drink. Have some deep conversations on really interesting subjects. And, most importantly, laugh with each other and just hang out. Being at uni and doing the same course, she would also always try to help me when I was struggling, which was something I really appreciated.

Anyway, sometime before Christmas, I screwed up and hurt her feelings. She didn't tell me this, and I only know because I got it out of her - through text. I've tried to apologize to her before Christmas. No real luck. I wished her Happy Christmas and New Years. She did the same to me.

Now we're both back at Uni. It got awkward, as I was with my friends and she was with her friends, both sitting at the same table. 

At this point, the WhatsApp conversation we had went like this:(she doesn't speak to me in person anymore or even look at me):

105,"Hosted my sister’s baby shower, only to be a second thought the next day
Hi Reddit! I’m wondering if I’m being too emotional about this and could use your opinion. I flew from Utah to Boston and arrived Thursday morning on a red eye. From 6am Thursday to 3am Saturday, my mom and I prepped for my sisters baby shower. I see her once or twice a year, but the three of us talk almost everyday on a group chat, and we’re close. My mom and I stopped prepping briefly Friday night to meet her, her husband, and her best friend (who flew in that night) for dinner- so that was the first time I was seeing her this trip, same as her friend. The best friend stayed at her house while I was staying with my mom.

So Saturday we had the shower for 25 people. Huge hit. Sister was very very appreciative and loved it. I had brought my suitcase in the event I slept over there, so I could have more time with her Sunday morning. This is generally normal. Once the shower wrapped, her friend brought my suitcase down...sort of a “here you go, bye.”

The main Sunday plan was to watch the AFC game back at her house, at 3pm. I woke up after some major sleep catch up at 10:30 and asked the mom/sister group text, “what should we do today kids??” To which my sister replied that her and her girlfriend are getting breakfast and meeting up with the girlfriend’s husband’s cousin (who also lives in Boston) and that they’d be back at the house at 2:30 before the game. 

My flight back to Utah is 6am Monday, so today (Sunday) was really the only time to see her.

I didn’t respond to that message. Around 1pm I told my mom that I didn’t want to watch the game with them, and I’d rather go downtown and watch it in a bar since I was feeling extremely hurt after putting all that work in for her shower, and then feel like an after thought the next day. So, Mom and I went to a bar and watched it.

Sister and her husband blew up at me for being so “selfish” and are not talking to me. Husband went so far as to say I’m not welcome to see the baby when he comes. Crazy.

I guess I should have put a smile on my face and just showed up for the game at 3? I would have if I ever stopped crying.

108,"Friend is acting distant, not hanging out much, i don't know what to do.
*Apologies ahead of time for the novel.*

So i (M 30s) have been friends with my buddy (M 30s) for several years, and there seems to be a repeating pattern with him and i really don't know what to do when this happens.  Instead of a long history, i'll just cite these last few months as an example.

So as i said, we've known each other for quite a while.  He's probably my best friend, although i wouldn't say i'm his (i'm not sure he really has one).  But anyways, prior to the last couple months we were hanging out as we usually do.  If we don't hang out every other day, we'd usually catch up over voice chat while playing video games, etc...  And this is the normal routine for us, we'd talk or hang out at least every other day, if not more often.  Then suddenly, a few weeks ago, it's like a switch went off and he's out.

What i mean by that is since then, i may hear from him once a week for an hour or so, at best; sometimes longer.  When we do chat, he mostly seems normal, but i can tell he's off.  So i've asked him what he's been up to, what's going on in his life, you know the usuals, and i get the usual answers for him: work, playing video games, seeing his parents occasionally.  I've brought up his absence and asked him what's going on, and his answer is usually the standard runaround, ""oh nothing"", ""i've just been avoiding everyone"", ""just doing my own thing"".  I pressed a little harder a couple weeks back and got a jokingly put ""i guess i've got a serotonin imbalance, haha"". I could sense his desire not to talk about it (which he never does, he hates discussing anything feelings related), so i let it go.

Next time we spoke, i brought it up again, asked him how he was doing with his issues, and got the usual ""meh"" or ""i dunno"".  When i asked what i could do to help him, he answered, ""you can stop fucking asking me about it"", so i of course let it go, and our convo continued as if there were no problems.  But of course there are, he's still MIA for weeks at a time.  The thing is, this is a pattern with him.  We're normal buddies, seeing/chatting all the time for months, and then WHAM, he's out and like this for weeks or a few months.  Then as if another switch goes off, he's back on again and acts normal and as if nothing's happened.  This has happened more times than i can count.

You know i wouldn't be so concerned if he were actually busy with life and doing things, but as he tells it in his own words when i do see him, he's doing nothing out of the ordinary (which for him is work and sitting home every night by himself (lives alone) playing video games (something we usually do together).  But as far as i can tell he's just sitting alone by himself every night.  

I've considered the possibility he's depressed or bi-polar (although you'd never get him to admit that), in which case i don't know what to do if he won't talk to me about it.  I've considered that perhaps i've done something to make him angry, but when he does come around (if i'm not bringing up this issue), he acts completely normal and we laugh and cut up, and whatnot like nothings wrong.  I've thought perhaps he's just not interested in being friends anymore, but he does still come around, and as i've said, after one of these episodes for a few weeks/months it's as if nothing's happened at all.  

So my problem is this.  I don't know what to do when he's like this.  I don't know how to act, what to say, how to approach him, etc.  You know, he's my best friend, i'd like to be there for him, to help if i can, but he rebuffs any attempt on my part to find out what's really going on, well besides him just ""avoiding everyone right now, and doing my own thing"".  He gets agitated if i push the issue.  So how do i handle this?  Is there a way to broach this topic that would get a better response?  When he does come around, how should i act around him?  What do i say, should i even bring it up?  I'm a very open person regarding my feelings and inner workings, and he's obviously not.  If this is just a thing he does, if it's not my fault and there's genuinely nothing i can do to help, how would i even get him to tell me that's the case if he doesn't like talking about it?  When he gets this way i just feel like i'm walking on eggshells around my best friend.  I dunno if it's ok to text, to invite him around, or whatever cause i'm afraid it's gonna bother him and push him further away.

So i'm sure i've left out a lot of details, but i guess that's the gist of it.  I would appreciate any meaningful advice anyone has to offer, especially if anyone around here has experienced anything similar with a friend.  Thanks to everyone ahead of time for replying.",ND
109,"How I Learned About My Birthfather... &amp; My Brother?
I remember when I was around 11, my little cousin, Lily, who was 6, came from Cuba to the U.S. with her parents. They stayed in our home for a few months until they were able to find a place. 

Right before they left for their new home; I was on my computer, I was 12, playing educational computer games. My family is chattering/gossiping in the living room per usual. I never had any interest in the family gossip, I just wanted to be in my own little space/world. Lily was not like that at all, she loved to listen-in on family drama. It was not long until Lily came barging into the room saying:    
""I know a secret.""    
""What?""    
""Roberto isn't your real dad.""    
""Liar.""    
""I'm not lying, they're talking about it!""    
""I don't believe you, so just leave me alone.""    
""Just ask your mom.""

After that she left the room and the seed of doubt was planted in my head. I did not think twice of it at that moment. It sure as hell bothered the hell out of me for days.. then weeks.. and eventually to months, to almost a year.

It wasn't long after, I started to doubt it myself. I did not really look like my father, Roberto. He was light-medium brown skin color, I had pale skin with freckles. My mother had a light tan. Things that I did not notice before started to bother me. The difference in skin color, I did not have his last name, there were not baby pictures of him holding me. I did not feel a connection to this man. I was 13, almost 14, when I decided to confront my mom about it while she was organizing important documents. There was something about this that was bugged me was that... I KNEW the answer to her question BEFORE she could respond. I was 99.9% sure already, but I still had that 0.1% in order to fully believe it.    
""Mom, can I ask you something?""    
""What?""    
""Is Roberto my real dad?""    
""No.""    
""Who is?""    
""I can't talk right now, I'm busy.""    

It was at that moment that I knew she did not really care to talk about it. Of course, I would bring it up again and she would brush it off just the same. ""I'm busy,"" or ""Not right now."" After a while, I stopped communicating with my mother and our relationship has suffered, to this day, because of it. It was not long after my mother asked for a divorce to my step-father. I remember her sitting me down on the couch and talking to me through it. I did not have a strong relationship with Roberto to begin with, it hurt to an extent, but it was not something that I felt devastated over. She did end up telling me that she married Roberto to provide me a father figure.  

On my 14th birthday, Roberto tells my mother and aunt that we need to leave the house permanently. The day after my birthday, we packed up our things the same day and left. All of this happened one week before school started, I was going to start high school. It was hard for the first few months, and around that time I started to get more curious about my birthfather as Roberto was separating himself from the picture. So I began to research him, ask my mother (always backfires on me), and listening to family gossip. One of the few things I caught was that my mother came into the U.S. legally, unknowingly pregnant. When she began to go see the doctors for a check-up, that is when she found out she was pregnant. Got married to my step-father, Roberto, when I was 2yrs, and from there I believed he was my father all along up until I asked her.

On April 20th, 2017 I received a random friend request on Facebook. The last name was exactly like my last name and strangely enough, looking at this guy's profile picture, he looked a lot like me -- strange. It took me a few days of speculation to finally grow the balls to accept the friend request after 6 days, April 25th.    
""May I ask who you are? And do you have any relationship to Alexander?""    
""I am his son. From what I see, you're my sister.""    
From there he asked for my phone number. I was still skeptical and asked for details such as my birthfather's birthday and my mother's name to prove it. Once it was proven, I gave him me information. I found out I had a little brother in Cuba, he turned just 19 this year in January. My birthfather and his family were in Cuba. My brother 3½ yrs younger than me. It is absolutely crazy thinking how I was raised as an only child, while he was raised knowing I existed somewhere in the world. I still have trouble wrapping my head around this.

I video chatted with my birthfather, Alexander, and brother, Lazaro, for hours. My father was crying. I did not get the full details on HOW they found me, it was hard to understand -- the Internet connection was extremely bad and it costs a lot of money to communicate from Cuba to the United States. I saw my grandparents for the first time. My grandfather was crying on the webcam and my grandmother was crying as well. They looked so happy and kept telling me that they prayed to God every day to just see me and that I was happy/healthy. We all laughed, we cried, we smiled. It was bittersweet. We asking questions and answering them through smiles, tears, and laughter. 

Unfortunately, a lot of time has passed, and that would be the first and only time I would have seen my grandmother. She died unexpectedly on December 24th, 2017. (R.I.P. Abuela Ramona) 

Hopefully, I can make a trip out to Cuba this year so that I can meet my family. My mother will not be joining me on my trip as she does not want to be part of that. I am not mad at my mother, I am just disappointed in the way she kept such a secret from me. I do not trust her on the same level as I did prior to all of it. My hands are shaking as I write all of this down. I am still trying to wrap my head around it. It is 2018 now and I will be planning a trip this summer to see them hopefully. The realization is hitting me that I am anxious beyond belief. I felt as though I babbled a little too much, but I needed to get this all out. This was therapeutic for me. I am going to sleep now, good night ladies and gentlemen. Sleep well.

I will be making a new post about meeting them. Thank you for reading.",ND
110,"Trying to help family of friend who committed suicide, any ideas?
My friend took his life almost a year ago and his family (wife and three daughters aged 10, 14 and 18) is still reeling. None of them are getting the emotional support they need. His wife doesn't regularly see her therapist, she stays out all night several times a week with her new boyfriend, the 18 year old has suicidal thoughts, the 14 year old just feels hated by mom and, along with the 10 year old, is not getting therapy. The 18 year old is getting therapy but she's hardcore into her new religious affiliation, hating mom and can't wait to leave for college 

I've talked to the wife several times and shared my thoughts about what's going on, she's receptive when I when I speak to her, but it's apparent after this amount of time that she has no real intention of going through with getting the kids counseling and getting into family therapy, staying home more, spending more time with the kids, less time with the husband, etc.

Does anyone have any idea how I can help? If I keep telling her what she's not doing well, I'm afraid she's going to shut me out and then I won't be able to do anything.  

If this isn't a good sub for this kind of thing and you have an idea what might be, please let me know. 

Edit--I live in NYC, they are outside of Dallas, TX, so seeing them isn't much of an option. Also, the wife has been cut off from her deceased husband's family due to some of her behavior, and doesn't have any support from her side of the family led by her mentally ill mother.

112,"In law family vacation + newborn
My husband and I have been married since August 2016. I am now pregnant due in April. We have been going on vacation with his parents for the last 3 yrs with his 2 sisters and last year their husband's too. They assume that we will be going on vacation this year too, the baby would be 4 months old I DONT WANT TO GO. FYI, his dad is great and hands off and his mom is very opinionated and gives too much advice but she means well and has been nothing but good to me. 

Reasons I don't want to go

1. We have lived with them for the past 5 months, I need a vacation from THEM. I am used to my own space and being able to retreat, I no longer really have that.

2. It will be a 4 hr car ride with a four month old. It may not be that big a deal but other than the car ride, I just rather be home and comfortable and not in another state staring at a beach for 7 days that I don't even want to be at.

3. My husband's older sister has gone out of her way to make me feel excluded in the past and said borderline mean comments. We made some headway last year but I barely tolerate her and avoid her and really don't want to be stressed out for 7 days because of it plus taking care of My baby. Everyone else doesn't see this, or sees her aggressive behavior as assertive.

4. I don't even know why I've gone the last 3 years as by the 3rd day I am drained. I am trying to better listen to myself instead of forcing myself to endureeat something I don't have to

My question is how do I tell them we are not going (my husband is backing me 100%) specially cause I know my MIL will resist 

Do you guys think it's ok that I don't want to go",ND
113,"Apologise and make up or move on?
Sorry it’s long, but I really need advice.

I’m a girl and he’s a gay guy so there’s definitely no feelings other than friendship. He only invites me to clubs occasionally, never to hang out. I felt used &amp; that he only invites me to pay for his drinks. Most of the time he ditches me to go off with random guys. One night I was going home early and he said ‘no you’re staying at mine tonight’, but within half an hour met some guy and said he was going home with him instead- and that didn’t even end up happening because the guy had a boyfriend, so he ditched me for no reason. He doesn’t even text me, because apparently he’s a bad communicator. On the flip side he constantly refers to me as ‘one of his best friends’, tells me he loves me and wants me to be his maid of honour one day.

He had a potential STI scare recently and asked if I’d go to the clinic with him. I ran out of my house and across the city to sit with him for 4 hours, didn’t even have time to brush my teeth! While we were waiting I told him this was the first time we’ve hung out outside of a club, and he said ‘it’s not my fault I’m busy’. I didn’t show it but I was really disappointed. He’s a student (as am I), not the president. He hangs out with his other friends constantly, stays at their house for a week at a time OR MORE, but has the nerve to tell me he’s too busy for me.

A week later he invited me to the club again and we left and walked to the bus stop together. He got on his bus and left me alone and drunk, again. It’s also strange because he’d always invite me to stay at his after nights out, but that randomly stopped a couple of months ago. Anyway, this time I had enough and ignored his messages after that. He then invited me to the cinema and I said yes. On the day I saw that he was with his other friends instead. He called me at night and said he was ‘tired and sick’ but we could meet 2 days later. I just said ‘ok’ because I didn’t want to confront him and fall out. 

On the day we were meeting he text me at 5pm and asked ‘are you still up for the cinema?’ and following advice from my friends, I said ‘no thanks’ and told him it’s unbelievable that after everything hes done he chose to blow off hanging out with me to hang out with other friends, and lied about it. I also said he’s not busy, he’s just a shit friend. He said he agrees that I’m a better friend than him but he never hangs out with anyone sober and he’s trying his best. He said he was making an effort to match his actions to his words by spending time with me alone. I didn’t reply. 

It’s been 4 days and we haven’t spoken since. He’s been with his other friends the whole time and frankly I don’t think he’s bothered. I know it sounds dramatic but I’ve barely slept since. I’m only getting 3 hours of sleep a night and I’m really sad and can’t stop thinking about the situation. I thought we were gonna be friends forever. I love him and want him in my life but everyone says I’ve given him too many chances. I’ve been thinking about apologising and making up, if nothing else at least just so I can feel better and start sleeping again. But I don’t know how it will be received or if anything will change. I don’t know what to do but this situation is killing me and I regret causing it in the first place. If anyone has even read this, thank you",ND
114,"Should I attempt to repair our friendship one last time?
So a few months ago a close friend and I had a sort of fight because I made a shitty passive aggressive comment.

I apologised shortly afterwards and felt terrible about it, even apologised more a day later.

Anyhow they said they needed some space, we happened to work together and sit right next to each other. So I left them be for awhile, they basically refused to even look or speak to me. After a month or so this started to take its toll on me, emotionally and mentally I wasn't equipped to deal with it. 

So eventually after 66 days of this, something I could not get away from I snapped and out of desperation as I was losing my mind I told I'm walking away as without communication the friendship is doomed.

So that's where it ended, they then carried on ignoring me for the rest of our time at work, they eventually left to go to a new place. Even at the farewell I was ignored till the last 10 minutes then got some communication.

After that a couple weeks later on my birthday they randomly wished me a happy birthday on a work group. Completely unexpected, sadly this confused the shit out of me and I drunkenly sent some message about being tired of all the hurt. Then I was blocked. I have since not contacted them in any way for over a month.

Do I make another attempt and how would I word it or should I just leave it and see if anything happens, we were really close and I feel awful about hurting them. It was the only argument in a year and a half we had. ",ND
115,"How to help my mom make friends?
My parents have had a rocky relationship since I've known them, some times worse than others.

They're in their 50s and recently had to move 2 hours away from their longtime home for my dad's work, and my mom is rather isolated. 

How can I help her make friends? They live in the country and can't really even get internet at their house right now. My dad has mellowed slightly with age, and is *generally* well-intentioned but clueless as to how this affects her and what she needs.

117,"Estranged mum possibly dying
Hi so I'm basically in need of some help here with a big issue from people who have possibly experienced something similar.
So it's a long story and I'll try and keep it to the parts the are mine to tell to keep things less complicated. So first things first me and my mother have had a somewhat rocky relationship from since I can remember, it was more of a rollercoaster and have been estranged for a year. Although the intense emotional disrupt from the relationship has lasted much longer. 
A brief history of this would be as follows, since a young age my mum has never been the ""settle down type"" she was always away either to holidays guys she would meet online would take her on too out every weekend. Me and my sister had to learn fast from a young age that we weren't able to live a childhood like most of our friends and basically raise our little brother. Sometimes she would be caught leaving us alone for so long and we'd have to stay with her friends so she wouldn't get in trouble and others we'd have to just make sure not to miss school so she wouldn't get caught. After years of this repeated behaviour some days easier some harder living from feast (when mum would bag herself a wealthy guy) too mum didn't win at bingo this week and a 40 fag a day habit is expensive habit to keep up why don't you just have beans on toast tonight, ofcourse I know that this is better than alot of kids we had a roof over our head and food in our stomachs it was always just chaos. Cut forward to my mum deciding she wanted to move back to ireland.
I was about 10 at the time and and as such didn't want to move that's when the abuse went from none of my boyfriend's stay because of my kids too physical, she had us all so scared saying that while we were staying with grandad and granny and they heard us complaining this is what we'd get she kick us or grab us, I had been beaten before by my dad before he left so this was nothing I couldn't handle and until now never really tried to think about since. I just remember that I stayed very quiet for those coming weeks.
When we moved to Ireland it was just after the first week a man showed up at my grandparents came in kissed my mum and said hello to me and my sister and said he was so glad to meet us. Turned out he was engaged to mum.....and they were planing on being married within the year, all of a sudden the reason for moving became clear. So After the breakdown of their relationship the next week the man moved back to America in the night and that was that here we were living with my grandparents in Ireland with no where else to go, my mum a big believer of why would I have to work I have kids stuck. Now I know from mum's point of view this must of been a heart breaking moment, but looking back I think this is where alot of my sadness in life begins and I hate her for it. I know hate is a horrible thing to hold onto but it's the only thing that got me where I am today and kept me as a person and I'm definitely aware I'm no Ghandi so judge me all you want but wait until I'm finished atleast.

The next few months were basically limbo, we moved too late to start the term at school so had to wait until the end of term and summer to join, that's from April till September if I'm remembering right of living in the middle of nowhere in Ireland, sleeping in a room with your young brother older sister nothing to do but wait for the day to end we would take walks here or there and get to go to mass on a Saturday night but minus that it's all we had I realised then that mum had failed to do the one thing that kept giving me hope that one day we could have a ""normal"" family she was nowhere to be found off on holidays for weeks one after the other while our grandparents fed us and kept us in their home. I remember a week going by without hearing anything from her and I had to assume that's it she's gone.

Yet she came back this time more shiny and brand new then ever, she said she had found us a house not to far away and go to school and it was the start of our new life. So ofcourse I felt overwhelmed at how amazing this might actually be. Mum made sure though to show her appreciation that Christmas by starting a huge family row with my her brothers and my grandparents, they had all chipped in to buy me and my siblings bigger toys for Christmas, I got a playstation 2 my sister got clothes and makeup and a bike my brother got lego ect that kind of thing, now Christmas was never a thing for us mum had explained from a young age that the santa thing was a lie and we would get what she could afford again this is not as bad as it sounds I'd rather the truth always and she at the end of the day was a single mother why would we expect anything ""big"" so ofcourse she didn't like the gesture and disowned everyone there etc
But we were moving to new house and starting a new life what more could I have wanted. So after living in the new house for a week mum decided that now my sister was 14 she could come on a ""girls"" holiday with her and as such they went the next week I think my sister was just happy to be out of school so went plus I didn't mind my brother was older and didn't need as much attention any more so I kinda looked forward to it, after they came back my sister let me know that she had done it again and gotten engaged and tried to warn me I guess that atleast I could know beforehand this time, the guy she was engaged to worked abroad the entire time so mum basically worshipped the computer so she could talk to him all the time she would sleep the same time as him (during the day) and be up all night, if ever the internet would go down or the house wasn't cleaned or dinners weren't in the house she would freak sometimes more physical then not, up until the day she said we were moving again so long story short the guy moved over they were engaged I was still never told by my mother and I had to sit through the guy explaining how he was gonna be my new dad for 4 hours while we drove to our new home, setting the scene it was a country bungalow which hadn't been lived in for years but me and my sister had done stuff like this in the past so we started into doing it up mum didn't like the physical side of it but loved the planning so she kept busy for a while, quick side note, I loved school, hated the abuse for being the English guy in an Irish school, I had ended up in hospital etc due to some of the abuse, we lived quite happily for a while until my ""new dad"" went back abroad to work for the summer, I started work that summer and so did my sister, my mum would be obcessed with my step dad when he was working who he saw etc until she decided he was definitely cheating (he wasnt) and decided she would too, she spent ages trying to get me and my sister to set up dating profiles for her and to cover on the phone if ever she was out on dates, when he returned as you could imagine arguments between them started and one thing my mother is good at is arguing she was always able to make him think he had done something wrong and she did nothing it didn't help that mum would threaten to throw us out if we ever told him what happened. So that was us for a while weeks of calm and weeks of arguing. Mum must have decided to quit the online dating world for a while and started into online poker, she would find out how much we would earn and take that as rent and spend it on online poker, she would take out debts, spend it on online poker, take my stepdads wages, spend it on online poker, this isn't a film so I won't say she was ever good or ever won, or more anything she did win didn't go straight back in. That summer we went with my step dad to his job abroad the company only could afford a one bed flat for the five of us and to keep stuff private I won't say place names but it was a tropical island, 5 people, one bedroom, one bathroom and since there was a casino down the road thanks to mum no money. That's when I realised that no matter how seemingly redicoulous the situation we were just furniture in mum's whirlwind lifestyle. One instance I'll go into detail would be this one from that summer. I had saved  £300 pound in secret we didn't have enough money for clean water or food for the next 4 days so I thought you know what I'll just say that I had a little bit of money I didn't realise I had and buy food etc. So I did, mum seen the food swore and gave off loads had me return it and took the money to the casino.....that is one instance of many. 
So after that summer mum went back to her online poker and we went back to normal until the next summer when mum decided she wanted to go to America with a friend from online, no prize for guessing what kind of friend, and that's the summer when I kind of shut down, I stopped eating and I stopped caring, I finally thought maybe if I very quietly and very slowly wasted away it would all be ok I didn't need to be around. I would cook everyone else's Meals and just say I had something to eat while cooking, I lost 4 stone in 2 months. Even as im typing this its hard to write. I talked to my mother once in those two months, the time she had no money and needed help. I went into auto pilot I would wake up clean the house play playstation with my brother make dinner and stay up till 3 in the morning with background noise sometimes I cut myself sometimes I would exercise till I vomited, I was slowly dying and that goal was what got me through the day that one day hopefully I wouldn't wake up, my sister was too busy with her new boyfriend and I didnt want to ruin her happiness my brother was too young to understand I thought and my step dad just wanted a clean house and for what he was wearing to work and eating at work to be sorted. 

So then the message came that mum wanted us to come to America and stay with her for a bit. Once there at the airport was the first time I'd seen my mum cry. The first time shed shown genuine concern for me, in fairness being ""big boned"" in our family was normal we are tall and none of us underweight, and there I stood 16 years old 6ft1 and a total of 8 stone must of been mad for her I guess.
So if you guessed it right remember no prizes she was in America with another man he like all of mum's affairs seemed nice but not really in it for the kids they would have their relationship and we would be in the background. A million times o wanted to tell the poor guy but being stranded in a different continent didn't seem like something that we could get out off so I kept quiet. Things went on as they would mum would act like she was single and we'd have to agree with whatever lie she told. Her visa ran out and we had to go back home.
These times seem like they should involve more but at this point I was too numb to the world I didn't register it I would live in the lie I had to and disconnect.

Mum and my stepdads relationship continued to take on more strain every time with more and more intensity. Mum did try a little more to be a mother to me and even took me to doctors apointments to help try and deal with my depression and ofcourse I don't blame her for it I had decided what I wanted to do and I am responsible for that. Our relationship improved a little and I actually gained some nice memories. 

So in the next year something well something really bad happened to me, I don't like going into too many details but the overall was I taken advantage of by someone I thought I could trust and to this day I still struggle with calling it rape but deep down I know that it was, my sexuality had never been a big deal to me as id always known and never acted on it but I told someone for the first time and well yeah non consenting acts occurred.

The reason why I'm saying this is because Its what lead me to try to come out to my mother, our relationship was at its best and so I felt I needed to tell someone what had happened to me and at the very least try and get some help because I was already mental as fragile as I was.

The long and short is it didn't turn out well, I mean imagine your worst situation and how low you felt. Now sink a little lower.

I tried to tell my friends and get help and if not for one person I don't think I would have made it through.

I still had to finish school though and with only a year left I lived through that situation and my past experiences taught me how to become numb.

Cut to me getting the results I needed and getting into the course I wanted. 

I moved out after much arguing and for the first time I was free to be the person I knew I could be, I made so many new friends i gained weight for the first time I was always independent and knew I was happy. Like actually happy.

I met a guy the most thoughtful caring person and still to this day I think I'm glad I didn't die because every day is worth whatever he'll I went through

Stuff with mum was still messy but it was away and in it's neat little box of past baggage. She would ring and talk about a new guy she met and then talk about how much she loves my step dad.

I finally thought you know what last chance I'm going to tell her about the guy in my life and if she didn't like it then I could move on and understand that maybe she wasn't supposed to understand and leave it at that but to my suprise she seemed fine with it.

Weeks past he met my family and my mum was lovely it was weird like she was a different person out relationship became so much better she still borrowed money shed never give back and cheated but we could talk about other things normal things.

Things continued with their ups and downs for a few years I carried on being happy and asked the guy to marry me which he said yes too. That's when the bigger troubles started.

So a quick list.
Mum wouldn't allow him to keep the engagement ring on.
She demanded monthly visits regardless of what was happening
Started alienating his family and comparing their lives and how different they were to us
Pitting my brother and sister against me and themselves

And just general, idk mental abuse without sounding too intense it was weird because anytime it would get seriously intense and be basically ruining any day to day stability she would stop and be nice again for a few weeks. 

It was unfair to my fiance though alot of the time it felt as if she kept making situations in which he would have to increasingly prove him self with the more he would do. Sometimes it came down to outright having to prove his love to me and became more and more frequent. She started to try and control our wedding ie spending, decor etc. 

The event that started the end was when we had to unfortunately rehome our cat due to him not getting along with our dog etc this sent mum berserk she rang my work demanding to speak to me and completely dressed me down on the phone and my fiance and how dare we calling me and my fiance worse than our father's  (both of which had left us as kids)
She said we weren't to rehome it and weren't allowed etc. My sister and brother got involved and were repeating my mother's words. Showing the same cycle of go along with mum or terrible things happen. 

So then there was an issue with Christmas this is a long one so to keep it short basically how dare I suggest to go to my fiances family even though he had been to ours and how as my mother I am not allowed at this point I'm 23 years old.

Straw that broke the camel's back, mum's dog unfortunately died, and with work I wasn't able to make it down and neither was my fiance, we were barred from the ""open house"" they decided to do for the dog and we received phone calls daily calling us all the names under the sun. My fiance had recently got a job with the nhs and was starting it on the Monday and as such said on Facebook he was happy to about this. Now I got a phone call from my mother but it wasn't a sane person it was unbelievable and to this day still scares me, from moments maniacal laughter to screaming to whispering she did it all at how dare he be happy on the day her dog was being cremated......it was some scary stuff like I am a huge animal lover yes but the way she felt personally attack that someone had something good in their life when she didnt that day was disturbing. That night my sister calls and is basically the same except for the line ""if you can't attend dog funerals then we can't attend weddings"" and that was it. That was the moment. 

I hung up the phone saying I wish them happiness and health and that if this is the way it is then that's it.

And that was it I blocked them from contacting me and had one of the best years of my life.

I have become mentally stronger, I am happier and I'm well I feel like the person I'm supposed to be.

Until today I get a message from an account on Instagram ""mum has cancer can you give me a number to contact you on""

Now in all this I haven't even mentioned everything like the fact mum has pretended to have a heart attack before and has lied about equally as worse.

I know it's a horrible thing to not want to reach out after a message like that but I don't want to go back to the pain I was in before I feel like can't breathe when I even think about giving my number and know that even if it's true and she does have cancer that I could never have a relationship that isn't toxic with these people I need advice and help but mostly I needed to share so thanks if ya read this far there's so much to this and I feel like I haven't even mentioned half the stuff that happened but please do I stick to social norms and try and be a good son or do I put my mental health first.

Thanks",ND

I just cant stand them anymore. They treat me like a shit compared to my sister. I never ask my parents for money I eat at home so they don't give me money for lunch I don't buy things I'm using old phone that i bought 6 years ago with my own money. But my mother changed 3 phones in the last year. They threat my sister a lot better they gifted her a phone for christmas i got some shitty speakers that had the price tag on and believe me their price was not close to the phone's. They bought her a new car last year they gave her the money for the driving lessons and she want money from them everyday. So i need a new PC at the moment so i thought that i might ask them because i really need it and that's the only thing i have ever ask my parents for my I haven't asked for a single cent in my whole life. Everything i buy i buy with my saved money from grandparents. I even buy my studentbooks with my own money. And they refused. They told me if i have the money to buy it but I spent all i had to buy furniture for my room if i didn't i would've gotten only a bed in my room. I feel hated. They don't spend time with me neither give me money. Yesterday I offered them to give me the money for the PC and when i have the money i will return them but they still said no. I legit have no idea why they do it. I don't go out often i don't argue with them  and i have decent grades in school. They are so unfair.",ND

Hey guys, ive known my best mate for 7 years and we finished high school and now both go to the same uni, we were so tight, like brothers. We were gym partners, helped other out with assignments, and hanged out so frequently. That was all until he got a girlfriend.

He met with this chick like 5 months ago and i was pleased for the dude, he seemed happy. 5 months on he still seems so attached to his girl, he rarey texts me and we used to play xbox together but none of those happen anymore. On the rare occasion when we do go to hang out he is always on his phone texting his girl, infact even in the cinema we watched a movie he was literally texting her during the film... even on xbox i hear the phone go off every minute or so

We done so much shit together.... i gave him a driving instructor with a family discount cos i knew the guy and he got his license now, i helped him raise $600 for a new pc, and even went into a lil business together where i invested and he knew the contacts.

This dude was my brother basiclly and now he never has time for me, we were so damn close and i wish things could go back to how they were without this girl because she is so paranoid of him talking to another girl

I dont get why he has done this to me, ive always been there for him and now he doesnt even respond to my messages, i see him active on facebook but doesnt even read messages... i helped this dude out so much in high school he was going to fail, i taught him some shit and thats how we got close and he passed literally because of me.

I dont know what to do... i feel like we are becoming so dinstant and only communicate once a week or so, im feeling so depressed and mentally hurt....

122,"My wife wants another baby, I don't. Are we headed for divorce?
Hi all,  I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this so let me know if it's not.  The title pretty much is why I'm here but let me give you some background.  

My wife and I dated for about a year before she got pregnant.  We quickly got married and had our first girl in 2005.  In 2008 we had our son, followed by our third, another girl, in 2009.  We were crazy busy for a while there and things finally calmed down a few years ago.  We made up for that by deciding that we should move to a nicer area.  We live in Vancouver where property costs a fortune.  To afford that, my wife had to go back to work full time.  She had been working 3 days a week.  She is a teacher so she still gets the summers, Christmas and spring break at home with the kids.  She kind of half joked about having a fourth child before the move but when we moved it was clear that we couldn't afford another baby.

Now we've been in our new home for about 1.5 years.  The kids have made new friends, settled into their new school and sports teams.  Our oldest will be heading to high school next year.

Now my wife wants a new baby.  She is obsessed with it.  It's all she thinks about and all she talks about.  She says the kids are getting older and they're not going to need her soon and she's getting depressed about it.  Every couple weeks it boils over and we fight or she bursts into tears again.

I don't want another baby.  Our youngest is 8, our oldest is 12.  I don't want to go back there.  I've moved on from the baby stage and I love where we're at right now.  We are crazy busy with sports and activities most of the year (hockey x2, baseball x3, swimming, art class, etc....).  I am happy where we are, I don't feel like anything is missing, there's no hole in my life.

If we were to have another baby, we'd have to move again.  Change the kids schools again.  Have the kids meet new friends again and join new sports teams again.  I don't want to do that to them.  I've also been carrying the financial burden for the last 12 years as my wife had finally give back to work full time.  I'm not saying she wasn't working at home taking care of the kids, she was.  I am saying that if we missed a mortgage payment, that was on me and it's stressful and it's nice to have some sort on that department once again.

I don't really know what to do, I'm afraid we're headed for a divorce but that's the last thing I want.  Should I have a baby so she won't divorce me?  What if we're in the same spot eight years from now when the baby starts to grow up a bit.  I asked her if she would go speak to a counselor with me but she says it won't change her mind that she wants another baby.",ND
123,"I am just confused what I should do or how I should act.(17M Asian)(Parent issues)
My dad a man I dearly respect for his achievements and the hard work he does for my family, treats me like shit in comparison to my twin brother. Often seeing my dad trying to be cheerful when talking to my brother and transitioning to his normal angry and grumpy self towards me, I can't help to be jealous. In terms of general achievements my brother and I are leveled equally but my brother is self centered and like an ass hole to my dad. Remembering a event few days ago, my dad asked him to come to a restaurant with the family but refused to go, reasoning that he didn't believe in family ties and emotions, only to be found playing with his online buddies when walking in(this happens  most week).

125,"Thoughts on multi-family and multi-generational households and family disagreements
Basically, I married into a Filipino family, and my MIL owns a fairly large chunk of farmland. She routinely expresses a desire for ""all of us"" (myself, my wife, our two kids, my sister-in-law and her husband, my brother-in-law, his wife, and his kid) to build a large house with a large living area. Each of us (read: each family) would get our own rooms, everyone would live together, and we'd all be one big happy family.

Except, not. I have a number of reasons for saying ""absolutely not"". Maybe it's my POV as someone that was raised in America, but I value independence and privacy. I want my own life, and my wife feels the same. Having family involved in everything you do, always having your kids being compared to other kids in the family, and always being treated like a child just sounds like hell. Not having the freedom to have sex or even choose what to have for dinner sounds like hell. No thanks.

It's be really easy if her MIL wasn't a good person, but she is probably the most kindhearted person I've ever met. She's always there to help us out, financially or if we need anything else. We're there for her the best we can, too, of course. So it feels really bad to turn it down, especially since I understand enough about her culture to know that this would feel like a slap in the face. And there's the financial aspect, since the land is already family-owned. Acting disinterested doesn't work. 

Anyone else have family that has tried this?",ND
126,"Grandmother asks for loan to estranged father, then refuses to carry debt
I'm mostly estranged from my father who has narcissistic personality disorder, lives as a squatter in the forest, and works only part-time. Meanwhile, I work in Silicon Valley.

His sister made a huge effort to contact me, which I ignored for months understanding that she likely has a personality disorder as well. Eventually, I relented and agreed to meet my father for dinner over the holidays.

In February, I received a call from my paternal grandmother saying my dad needs a loan because he lost his temporary job (he has regular seasonal employment) and employment-insurance benefits have recently been changed where he lives. I called my dad and he asked for a loan of $5,000. I felt sorry for the guy, so I wired him the money. After further thought, I feel this is quite a bit more than he needs to be homeless for a few months and carry his credit card payments until getting new employment.

Meanwhile, my grandmother has just sold her mobile home for $60,000 and left a voicemail to tell me of this and ask if I was willing to drive down and pickup some boxes. This isn't realistic, if I did go there I would fly rather than drive for 8 hours.

I called her back and asked if she would assume her son's debt. This saves me the stress of servicing the loan and I have no interest in lending money whatsoever. Since she has cash from selling her house, she is easily able to do this now. Her son can pay her back.

She told me that the money from the house was needed for her retirement and that she's ""on social security."" I responded, ""I'm saving for retirement too."" (I make the full $18,500 401(k) contribution each year to avoid ending up in the forest like my dad and this in addition to paying into social security which probably won't even exist when I am 67) ""That's no way to talk to your grandmother. I'm going to hang up if you..."" at which point I hung-up the phone.

My instinct her is to forget about getting the money back and just disconnect from all three: dad, grandmother, and the aunt (who I should have just ignored).

Any thoughts?",ND

128,"I’m afraid of my family falling apart after my grandfather passes away
I need advice. My mother passed away from cancer 4 years ago now. I have two brothers in their 20s. One hasn’t finished his associates and the other in nursing school but takes every chance he can get to get away from helping the family. My father is an irresponsible alcoholic who thinks it’s beneath him to wash even his own dishes.

I currently live in San Francisco and trying to get into medical school and making up for my precious failures in college.

My grandfather is the patriarch of the family. He always has been and has been the glue to keeping it together. I’m worried that if my grandfather passes away that my father will go deeper into alcoholism and my little brother will be his forever caretaker. 

I’m so scared. I’m the only female in my family left and I feel so overwhelmed and burdened. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know where to go. I don’t even know how to help myself.

129,"I'm having trouble getting along with someone I want to consider a friend
Long story short: This guy was originally a friend of a friend, I'll call him Jeff. We all go to the same college and have the same mutual friends. Jeff and I got along pretty well for a bit but recently all he does is piss me off

While I get the whole ""friends mess with each other"" idea, but it just doesn't fly with me and this guy. I may mess around with my friends once in a while and I'm a big joker, but for the most part I just like to have a good time together whenever we do anything whether we play video games, go to the gym, etc.

On the other hand, it feels that Jeff goes out of the way to piss me off no matter what we do because he KNOWS it will piss me off. I know typically you want to show no reaction to this kind of thing to avoid fanning the flames but I can't help it

I don't know how to deal with him or get the message across. When I tried to sit down with him and talk man to man, Jeff didn't seem to take me seriously and kept going ahead with his previous antics. I talked with our other friends (who have known him longer than I) and they all just told me something along the lines of: ""he doesn't mean anything by it, it's just how he is don't get offended"". But unfortunately, we don't mix that way.

Now Jeff's not inherently a bad person, when he's serious he's actually a pretty good guy. He has helped me out in some tough binds before and has done so for the other guys too, all of which I greatly appreciate. But his behavior to me on a day to day basis just really really pisses me off",ND
130,"What's wrong with my dad and what should I do about him?
(sorry for the long post)
I wasn't sure where to post this, so I just put it under r/family.
A bit of background info: My parents have been divorced since I was 4.
For as long as I can remember, my dad's been threatening the things I like to keep me in line. When I was 5 or 6, I had a pet bird that he often threatened to kill or release into the wild if I didn't play the piano. These days, he threatens to sell my phone and my computer (which he knows I need for homework) when I don't attend swim practice at a club I've been going to for years. He's also tried to use me to threaten my mom by refusing to pay for my braces (which cost about $5000) because her arthritis has been preventing her from taking me to swim practice. Not to mention she's unemployed. He's also said some pretty hurtful things about both of us when he's gotten mad. He called me egotistic and has told me a couple of times that he no longer looks forward to picking me up from my mom's house, and he's called my mom negative and accused her of not putting in the effort to give me a good childhood. He often tries to guilt-trip me when I piss him off, usually by telling me about how much effort he puts into raising me and how he does everything while I waste my time on my computer. There was a point back in 6th and 7th grade when he was pretty much a textbook case of emotional abuse, but he's improved since then and it gave me hope that he'd stop the threats and angry rants. Also, he rarely goes through with his threats, although that doesn't make them any less hurtful. Besides the threats and somewhat frequent outbursts, he's a generally normal parent.
I can get my mom to file for a full transfer of custody, but I'm afraid she can't handle the financial burden of having me full-time. I'm also a little suspicious of her because I remember her hitting me before my parents divorced, even though she denies it. However, she's a much better parent than my dad right now.

I had this female friend that I met almost two years ago. Both of us were really nice with each other and we were pretty good friends at first, but my introverted mind did not help with that.

I used to always text her almost every single day of every single hour to the point that she told my friend that I was annoying her (I knew that a couple of months later). I knew that something was up and that I made her upset but I never really knew what it was. I tried many different approaches to become her friend again but it all lead back to her thinking that I want to date her (she is not the type of person who would want to date at this age). After a year or so is when I figured out that I made her uncomfortable and gave her the notion that I wanted to talk to her only to date her and nothing else. I had an idea to confront her and apologize to her and tell her the truth of what I wanted from her but I keep having panic attacks and anxiety every time I think about doing it.

hi..i am 19 yrs old and currently in college. 

please bear my poor English.  so i know the title is kinda vague and idk i felt i wld get some views n advices here.
so  it all  strtd from childhood. My uncle  was jealous of dad in evrythng. Dad was adored by all d siblings he wasnt, coz he was grandmas eye n youngest. Actually grandma spoild him...kinda the pampered kid who is arrogant. He had his ways in evrythng.  Ok den marriage,  n kids. not bragging but i must say this...my siblings kinda ""got our shit together"" den his kids..in terms of academic performance or like social life in general...so maybe yeah that added  Again highr level of jealousy.  He evn said i got 1st rank in my high school  (which i did..nerdy days)coz its a ""rotten school"". i am in another city too now, not homwtown. Den my uncle sent his kids to outside cities too , but all faild wid single digits. Shame added to jealousy probably . after some time he bought  Hyundai i10 car. after some time Dad bought i20 too...actually the thing is it was the time when we were kinda grown up too  and a car was necessary plus  i hv four siblings so i20...mayb my uncle thought it was kinda a competition..childish i know. 

Bam! N then came  d issue of d ""way"".  see my dad , uncle,  and dads elder brother , they all lived together before(joint fam)....Wen they  seperatd land, they decided de sud leav 10 feet land for vehicle...lemme explain that bit.
its like imaging three houses next to next and we need to leave path to the right so that we cn park beside respective house...the main entry being point being our uncle's because his house is first, middle dad then dads elder bro.
 my dads elder bro did(left 10feet to the side then constructed new house), dad did, he dint.  N wen dad told, he said ""u dnt evn hav a car nw(then ). I will gv way wen u buy."" N my grandparents let him hav his way. Actually its all der fault. they never take d authority.  N wen we bougt the car, he refusd straight. We dint hav place to keep our new car. We kept in a locality friend' house. Such emberasment. N uncle dint gv ""way"" all d tym. Dad didnt try to make an issue coz our grandparents wer der n he thought to make them approach n deal first.. they didnt.  They  wer too spineless. Its der land, de r parents de but  dint hav d guts to tell my uncle ...hey "" you r wrng"".  Dats why i hate dem when de dramatise to love dad when they  need money. N things remaind same.  Den grandpa was sick. then Dunno smthng hapnd, dads elder bro and another close relative were angry at my uncle for an issue. So they went to his house to talk. N he opend d door n said m busy go away and other rude things.  she (relative ) slappd him. He hit her n broke her head. Den  dad ran in(we lived next to each other so the ruckus is audible) .He broke dads nose n their head. All wer hurt but kept silent and tried to handle internally  coz he is family. Bt he sent police, to arrest dem. D police laughd n went away, saying ""u  beat them and den u  cmplained?""....from  then on der wer court cases n cases. 


so that was what happened.  Problem now is he moved away and now his land is bought by another relative but he still comes and make a scene. plus he poisoned his kids like "" you arent allowed to say his name (dads) in house"".
its like he is using that incident  (land dispute n court cases) to dissipate all his jealousy and ego on my dad. coz there many ppl involved but he is just on my dad.
i mean yeah you adults hv issues okay.. but dont spoil the next generation. 

i know this is getting too long n no specific questions is asked ..imma answer in comments if i get any reply lol.
i just wanna get sm views and how would you handle this...plus advice because i dont wanna spoil the relationships between my cousins n us because of whatever is going on with the adults.",ND
140,"Brother owes Mother money, lives with her and isn't paying rent. Advice please?
Not really sure which sub is the best place for this, so I've cross-posted in r/family, r/legaladviceuk and r/advice. Please let me know if any of them are inappropriate or if there are better subs for this. Thanks!

The back story to this is long and possibly convoluted, but the tl;dr is my brother has had financial troubles for many years. In 2012, after the death of our grandmother, our mother paid off a large sum of my brothers' debts. He then paid some of this back with his own inheritance from the same. As a result of various relationship and/or financial cock-ups he has then loaned various further sums from our mother but with almost no repayments. He then ends up in a position to either bail out back to our mothers or lose employment and go wherever it is you go when you have no home or job.

To be frank, we (myself, my partner and my mother) are at a loss as to what to do next. We think that perhaps we only have one realistic option (to kick my brother out and cut our losses) but this is something we would rather avoid. So we're asking Reddit for advice. So to  (try yet fail to) cut a long story short...

My brother moved back in with my mother in early December 2017 due to the breakup of a relationship. When he did so, he agreed (verbally) to both pay a very reasonable rate of rent and payments towards previous debts owed toward our mother (both monthly). He was given December as a 'payment holiday' of sorts. Two weeks later my brother took out a loan to replace his car as he needed transport to and from work. His previous vehicle was written off toward the end of his previous relationship and he did not replace it with the money gained from the resultant insurance claim. Due to poor credit history, our mother was guarantor for this loan.

Due to concerns regarding my brothers previous unreliability with regards to money my mother decided to make a written and witnessed agreement with my brother regarding rent, the loan, and payment of previous debts. However, we are all collectively broke (not as broke as my brother) and so paid legal advice was out of the question. After some research I drafted a basic agreement, it was signed and witnessed by my mother, brother, partner and myself. In hindsight I should probably have used a solicitor for this but it is what it is. 

Fast-forward to 05/02/2018 and no payments have been received for anything. My mother received both an email and text alert for late payment on the loan that she is guarantor of on 31/01/18 but no other correspondence. She has not contacted the loan company but has received no further correspondence so believes my brother has paid this instalment at least. My mother also received a phone call from the garage that my brother bought he new car from, for which he loaned the entirety of the cost as the majority of the loan my mother is guarantor. He still owes them money. 

In short, besides kicking him out of my mothers house and saying goodbye to both my brothers previous debts (and therefore a large amount of my mothers money) and also resigning my mother to paying for the loan he took out in December, what can we do? Does the written agreement we made mean anything legally? What can I do to help my mother claim the money she lent previously? Or are these things lost causes? 

Any and all help is much appreciated. We just don't know what to do, but don't want to see my  brother completely on his arse (unless I've put him on it...).


TL;DR My brother owes my mother a significant amount of money, lives with her, she is guarantor for one of his loans, he has not paid his agreed rent etc. and we know he owes others money. What do we do now? Can kick him out, don't want to, seems likely may have to soon. Cannot live with or afford this.

142,"How can i connect with my sister?
We live in different worlds.
She's two years older than me. We've always been close, but never on a deep level.

When we were kids, we often played. 
In school, she was sporty and popular. I was bullied and quite. 

In her teens, she began following the mainstream, wearing the latest fashion. Always wearing makeup and black n white clothing. She craves luxury, but she's not bitchy. She's kind and generous. 

I like alternative styles. I love spiritually, and science of developing a healthy and peaceful mind. I don't have a need to be like everyone else. I LIKE to be childish.

It's so hard to connect to her since we're so different. 

Any tips or methods to bring us closer?

143,"Losing my brother
My brother died suddenly Friday night. He was 38. He was pretty much estranged from most of the family, spent some years making bad decisions and doing drugs and it caught up to him. He was trying to straighten out his life and cut out drugs and negative friends, from what I’d heard. He was in the ICU recently with heart failure and pneumonia. We talked while he was in the hospital, a lot of apologies and crying and encouragement, just a brother and sister having a conversation. The next day his blood pressure was supposedly good enough for him to be released. 10 days later, he was gone. 
My family members are taking it in their own ways. We all had unresolved things, a relationship we were hoping to rekindle, a bond I wanted to forge again with my big brother. He was my best friend and hero growing up. My biggest challenge as an adult. I feel so much regret and heartache over this, I can’t even begin to explain. He didn’t have an easy life. We lost a lot, he went through a lot, some of it was because of his choices, I really feel he was trying to make it right but it was just too late. We lost our grandpa and dad in the last 2 years, now my brother who was the first born grandson. I don’t think I’ll ever get over this.",ND
144,"What's wrong with this friendship?
I need some thoughts on this situation.

Three friends of 20 years decide a month a head of time to go to a Gatsby Party for New Years Eve. All of them are single. Well, at least one of them is somewhat single. The less-single one is Charlotte. Charlotte has a new beau, who she has been seeing on the low for about two months. Melanie and Jenny can see that Charlotte is smitten. Ok, no big deal. All is good. ""Do you, girlfriend! Just don't lose yourself"". (Names have been changed)

So everyone is planning for the NYE party. Melanie and Jenny have their outfits ready to go. The dress that Charlotte ordered is not going to be in on time for the party, so the back-up plan is to go the mall and find a new dress. Melanie goes with her, and Charlotte, reluctantly buys the best dress she can find, but it is not nearly as fabulous as the first dress she ordered online - which, again, won't arrive on time.

The ladies planned to all go to Melanie's house early on the day of NYE to slowly get ready, play some good music, eat pizza and have a few drinks before they summon the Uber to take them to the party.

The night before, however, the party's promoters announce on facebook that the venue has changed to another location. A little aggravating, but not a big deal. They decide they're not gonna let that mess up their NYE and want to have fun anyway.

Anyhow, on Jan 31, at 5pm-ish, Charlotte sends a group text to the other ladies:

Hey ladies, i know you'll probably hate me for this, but I'm not gonna go. I wasn't feeling it since they announced the change of venue and now James asked me to go to Vegas. So I rather do that. I apologize for the late notice"".

Needless to say, the other women were very upset.

Any thoughts? Should the other ladies accept that?",ND

149,"Is my sister (31) a toxic person, am I (28m) overreacting? Should i confront her or should i talk to a specialist for a peace of mind?
Hello, 28 male. I'll try to be as brief as possible. I've never been very close with my sister. We talk and communicate and help each other (lately I'm the one helping) but I've never really... connected with her. In a few words - if she wasn't my sister I would've never consider her a friend or someone worth keeping close to me. As a child she was very abusive (maybe not the best word) in terms of getting what she wanted - tantrums, fights, screaming, being the centre of attention - you name it. Later on in her teen years she had constant fights with our parents over staying late at parties and so on. She was grounded more than a handful of times during that period. Over the years her attitude stayed the same. She has no qualms about burning bridges with people. Friends, family - you name it. If she gets in a fight with someone she would never stop and think twice before saying something that she may regret later on. Like an animal that's being threatened - bite, bite, bite. This would often lead to tentions in our family as she and the other party won't speak for couple of weeks. She has a child now (1.5y.o.) and the poor kid is truning out to be a real brat. We would go over to her house and the kid is throwing tantrums all over the place. She says ""well, he wants to sleep"" but won't go to the other room with him. In the meantime the kid is touching the food, throwing forks and we are all trying to keep all the food, beverages, our phones and what not away from him and she would say somehthing like: ""well, yea, the fun of being a parent. You'll see when you have one, ha ha"". Such a fun. And she is really obsessive. She's the one that does the talking. At this point I know everything about pregnancy, childbirth, brestfeeding, nutrition, whats good and whats bad for the kid. She and the kid are in every conversation. Some one would say ""I didn't get to clean the house this weekend"". Well guess what? She didn't get to clean the house too, because of the kid. ""Wow, house cleaning... Yeah, haven't done that in a while now. But you really can't, once you have a kid. You'll see"". She is lacking friends and communication, I can tell. All she talks about is some Facebook groups with other mothers that we don't know. We have never heard of them, we are not bothered to but here we are - we know about some random mom and her kid's sleep schedule, eating habits, inside jokes we don't really appreciate or care to. And if its not her and the kid in the centre of attention its her and my BIL fighting over stupid, stupid shit that I don't want to hear or know about. And its not only me - my gf, our parents, mutual friends and so on. We are so deep in that shit, that some of our mutual friends are making excuses to avoid them. And my sister's answer? ""Oh, they'll see! Things are gonna change between us and them. I'll see them when they have a kid"" We (me and my GF) are avoiding them too, as much as possible! But if you confront her you better be ready to go to war. She can't handle critisism. To her this means a fight. And if  get in a fight with her you better be ready for a throwdown and to hear some bad shit about yourself. Thruth is I don't want to confront her to spare my self all the drama. The yelling, the tantrums, her playing the victim how hard it is, seeking support and involving my mother for example.... It probably is hard. Sure is. But after more than six months of me helping them with their house renovation, using my car as a truck or taxi, depending on what they need (building materials, groceries, doctor appointments etc you name it) I'm kinda sick of it and lost! I really can't tell - am i overreacting over this? If not - should I confront her and hope that she will take my criticism as an adult. I'm really thinking of seeing a specialist seeking an advices and peace of mind. 
Sorry for the rant! Your input is much appreciated!",ND
150,"A Question About Honesty in Communication
My friend recently graduated from Business school with a degree after 3 or 4 years. However, she continually asks me very simple, basic business questions that many non-business majors would know, stuff that I would think would've been covered over the first few classes. She's originally from a different country and still struggles a bit with English yet she went to school in Canada where all the courses were taught in English. The way I see it, if there was that much of a language barrier, she wouldn't have been able to pass. Even if she had gotten help with her studies, she still would have needed to retain this knowledge long enough to pass her exams, which weren't that long ago. The only thing I can fathom is that she had other people doing her work for her and taking her exams but I don't want to believe that and, besides, it's a bit of a stretch. 


As well, she currently has a mentor who's supposedly helping her conduct business research, yet she still messages me with questions about assignments they've given her, saying she doesn't understand basic stuff. I even told her that if she doesn't understand what her mentor is assigning her, she should be forthright and tell them, otherwise they wouldn't be able to fully help her. She agreed but I noticed she's still asking me the same questions insteading of contacting her mentor. 


Anyone have any insight into this? I've brought up similar things with her that I felt didn't make sense or were inconsistent but she's rarely honest, preferring to answer dismissively or cryptically. Not sure how to proceed from here.",ND
151,"Coursemate [19F] wants me [18F] to find potential housemates, has high demands but i’m doing all the work :/
So at uni it’s time for students to be looking for a house to rent for the next academic year. Usually people live with friends they’ve made and such or just go on facebook and join groups. 

The place we’re interested in is a 6 bedroom house, I personally wouldn’t mind an all female house or with 2 boys and 4 girls idc. But my coursemate said she’d prefer 3 girls and 3 boys. Well so far we have 4 confirmed girls (me, coursemate and a girl that SHE found), i’m currently getting enquiries from girls and a few guys but if i’m doing this on a first come first served basis, it’s looking to be an all girls house.

She made me look for the house, call the agent, book an appointment, put an ad on facebook.... She said that she has some anxieties doing some of this which i guess i  can understand bc sometimes i have bouts of social anxiety that i can’t help so i am a little sympathetic... But she’s being very demanding, i couldn’t look at any houses over the weekend bc i was with my boyfriends meeting his parents and his family so i couldn’t drop all that and go on my laptop doing all of this !!

If i tell her that it’s looking to be an all female house with maybe one guy, i’m a little scared to know her reaction... But then again, she’s made me do all this work and yet would have to audacity to complain ?! 

I feel like she has a certain demographic in her head of what kind of boys she’d like in the house (she’s a lesbian so it’s not like that) ... idk ... 

I’m not sure what to do or say... shall i accept the girls that are actually willing to pay and be proactive or decline their offers JUST because my mate “wants boys”🙄?

**TLDR** friend and i need to look for a house with other ppl for next year, she’s making me do ALL the work, is demanding and wants some boys to live with us. Only girls have been seriously enquiring... how do i tell mate ?",ND
152,"26 thinking of moving family upset

Okay so this past 5 months have been overwhelming. I’ve had a lot of major things happen. I got married in October and over the past year I’ve been connecting with my father and half brothers (who I just consider brotthers) and that whole side off the family. My dads never been apart of my life. I saw him probably about 4 times out of my 26 years on earth. The last time until this past week I saw my dad was when I was 10 so 16 years ago. That was also the last time I ever flew on a plane. I decided to fly down about two weeks ago for a week and I had such a good time connecting with my brothers and my oldest brothers wife and my nephew and grandparents and everyone! I loved the idea of everyone together closely and always at each others houses and I got along so well with my brothers and it was really nice. My brother and sister in law decide to that they’re going to move back to Florida where my dad and dads family is and they all really want me to move there. They love the idea of us getting close as a family and setting traditions and spending holidays together. Honestly I love that idea. My problem is my mother raised me, she’s always been there for me. She has nobody other than me. She doesn’t even have a car I drive her places. My grandmother who is also soo important to me she’s my second mother she’s been in a nursing home for 10 years and she’s confused a lot but still not that confused. The thought of leaving them makes me want to cry and I feel like I couldn’t. My mom would feel so betrayed and angry at me. She’s already feeling a little hurt because I’m getting closer with my dad that family. Which is wrong but she has a lot of issues of her own. The thought of leaving my grandma I could never. :( I just don’t know what to do. I’ve never left NY my husband also has his father here and his father would hate me if I brought “his son” away. My husband acts like he dose not care but ofcose he must. I just don’t know what to do I feel so stuck like if I even considered moving I’d feel so selfish and horrible. I couldn’t leave my mom and I feel like she wouldn’t come with me she’d be so angry that I was “choosing my father who did nothing for me and his family who ignored me” over staying near her. Idk this is probably all too soon also but I just want to form good relationships with my brothers and nephew and soon to be niece. And my dad. I don’t want my life to pass away and miss it all. Ever since I came back from visiting them for a week my mom has been giving me such a guilt trip about spending my money to go visit them or how she feels used and it’s crazy to me. Idk what to do But this is for sure a rant. Thanks for listening forever did.",ND

My best friend of over 10 years recently took her first trip to New York City. I was so excited for her, and she had asked about what my favorite things to do when I was there were. I knew that she would love the view from the empire state building and decided to buy her a ticket up as a christmas gift. When I gave her the gift, she was really excited but as her trip has come and gone it is apparent that she didn't go despite texting me multiple times on the trip saying how excited she was and mentioning vague plans for when she might go up. I know she arrived with little to no real plans for the entire week and spent a lot of time wandering, which is why I feel that letting the gift go to waste is kind of disrespectful. I also feel that if she were upfront and let me know that she didn't go would be much better than trying to ignore that it happened. I want to know what other people's thoughts on this are before I talk to her, and also maybe how to approach her about it because this is something that is uncharacteristic of her and kind of hurtful to me.

155,"What's the deal with my husband's future best friends wife?
Hi everyone, I am having a problem and I'm not sure what to do about it. I am led to believe that my future husband's (married next month) best friend's wife dislikes me, but I'm getting mixed signals. I have always (I thought) been nice to her. 

When we hang out as couples, everything is fine and we get along great. We have a similar education level and both come from a science background, so it's easy for us to talk. We have spent hours hanging out in these situations. We even all took a road trip together this past summer a few states away to attend a very lovely (albeit very strange) wedding of another of their mutual friends, and we went out to dinner and shopping while the boys were at the bachelor party. 

It seems like whenever I try to plan anything though, she isn't available, even if her husband is. I planned a surprise party for my fiances 30th birthday that I had been talking about for months--her husband was there, and at the last minute, she couldn't attend. He didn't even tell me she wasn't coming until he showed up without her. We visited their home on 4th of July weekend and there invited them to my parents house (they have a pool) for the holiday. He showed up, she didn't because she was ""sick"" (read: hungover.) Her husband showed up for an hour or so and she was continually calling him asking when he was going to come home and take care of her. 

The thing that makes me think this isnt a string of coincidences is my bridal shower. It is tomorrow, and I have found out she will not be attending. She Rsvpd to my mom with just a generic ""I can't make it, we're busy"" but then a few days later, her husband messaged my fiance asking if he wanted to hang out on the day of my shower.

I have always been nice to her, and I'm not sure whats going on. Anyone in Reddit land have any advice? Her husband and my future husband have been best friends since high school and this is bugging both of us. ",ND

162,"A friend cut me off
So recently a friend of mine cut me off and I’m not really sure why. I guess to understand my concern it would be best to get the whole story. 
I had first met her earlier this school year. Our desks were right next to each other in math class. Back then, she was very talkative, sociable, optimistic, and energetic around me. I’m not always the most talkative type but that didn’t seem to bother her at all. She always shouted for my attention to say hi to me when passed each other in the halls. She asked for my number, introduced me to a few of her friends, and even invited me over to her house for lunch during one of our off periods. We texted a couple times though I will admit each time I kept feeling like I was annoying her. 
Eventually, she had invited me to come with her boyfriend and group of friends to hang out at the mall over Christmas vacation. I was so excited. However, when the day finally came, I couldn’t help but feel like a third wheel. She was much more focused on her boyfriend than she was on anyone else and the only time she noticed me was when I had wandered off without telling any of them. That wasn’t cool of me, I admit, but I just didn’t feel needed or even wanted there at times. Later that night though, I texted her and apologized for not being that social but she it was all fine. 
But I still couldn’t shake the feeling that she was upset with me. When we came back from vacation, my suspicions grew. She was a lot more quiet and distant from me and was usually on her phone with her headphones in whenever I was around. It was around this time that I started to become a lot more needy. She still responded to my texts and told me that the reason she was so quiet was because she had a headache. But I couldn’t help but notice that she was still pretty social around her other friends. At one point when we were walking in the halls, she had her headphones in and didn’t say a word to me but the minute she saw one of her other friends, she took her headphones out and screamed for his attention. All while I was standing right next to her. 
It was a week before winter vacation when we got into an argument. You see, she was aware of my depression and offered her assistance in helping me deal with it. However, in our argument, she expressed her displeasure with how she felt she was putting in all the effort into dealing with my problems. I tried apologizing to her, probably getting a bit too dramatic about it, but she just expressed her annoyance at how I constantly needed her assurance and that if I don’t try to change myself, she won’t be my friend anymore. Eventually, I apologized for my part in the argument and how I didn’t make her help feel appreciated, but I also explained to her that I was doing something about my depression. I see a psychiatrist and take antidepressants every night. Still, she insisted that I needed to change. But by this point, whenever I spoke to her in person, she always seemed disinterested and kind of annoyed. When I asked her if she had a problem with me, she would always say that she was either busy or wasn’t in the mood for it. Eventually, she responded that she needed space for the whole vacation, so I didn’t text her at all. But when the vacation was over, I tried to text if everything was fine now only to discover that she had blocked my number. Now, she doesn’t even acknowledge my presence anymore and almost seems to actively avoid me. 
I apologize if this is really long. I just wanted to be as detailed as possible. At this point, I just feel at a loss and confused about what happened. I’m not sure if I did something wrong or if she was ever my friend at all. I mean, our friendship felt genuine those first months before Christmas. But now I just don’t know what to think or do.

When my brother plays his game and I want to tell him about something he gives me an attitude just because he's mad at the game since he sucks at video games (I don't know why he keeps playing the same game that he dies in a lot) or he just plains ignore. I think now I  know why I was never happy living at home. A lot of bad things happened to me in the house I grew up in. (it's a long story for another post).I'm more happier away from home than when I'm at home. The only time I feel like I get respected and treated nicely is when I'm with my boyfriend, my best friends, and my other family members. Sadly I can't move out yet since I'm not working at the moment but I'll be working soon and making enough to leave the place I can't even call home most of the time. ",ND
166,"A vent more than advice post
my close friend who i haven't seen in a while has a few days off so we plan to go for a catch up drink on Tuesday afternoon
shes going to her boyfriends on tuesday evening, i dont want to step on any toes so i make sure to ask what time is ok to meet for drinks/when she would want to leave

she messages me saying ""bf says i can come over tuesday evening whenever suits me""

half an hour later she messages again saying ""bf said he was hoping we could spend tuesday afternoon together before i stay the night at his.""

and asks to move the drinks to another day - even though tuesday is my *only* day off this week and any other day is actually really inconvenient for me and her and her boyfriend both have free afternoons for a few days in a row.

not sure if the bf is getting annoyed that i'm spending more time with his girlfriend (barely) and that's why he changed his mind in that half hour between messages, but it's just getting to me.

tl;dr - today i feel like i've been put on the backburner, and i'm not any kind of priority when it comes to time spent with my friend. and it sucks.",ND
167,"I have a close friend who is problematic, but not towards me
A couple of years ago, I had a falling out with one of my friends and during this time, I fell back on this girl in my class, who I will call Blue. We got close in only a few months, and eventually, this will be the only time we will ever be in the same class. It was just the two of us. I'm in one of her classes now and my friends still associate me as her best or one of her closest friends. It's not a particularly good association (doesn't reflect on me though, just her).

A lot of people don't like her, especially the people I'm friends with now. I haven't been around for a while (I moved down to Brighton for a bit of time) and I haven't seen her either, but I know that she doesn't have a lot of friends. I've been hearing stories and past anecdotes about her that really troubled me, so I'd like to have some advice.

This one girl (who would never lie about something like this because she's so sweet, probably still hasn't gone through puberty) said that Blue once pit her up against the teachers and made her cry because she was so stressed and she didn't understand the situation. Blue has a kind of controlling personality and will not be open-minded to other people's ideas and input. An idea of close friend of my close friend, Yellow, was swept by as Blue simply dismissed it, and just wrote what she wanted to do in a group project. Yellow is also quiet, VERY passive and formerly a good friend of Blue and to some point, even I, so when I heard this happening to Yellow, I was really shocked that Blue could even do something like that.

She will also guilt-trip you and self-deprecate herself. She will tell you that everyone hates her and that she's really bad at a subject she does really well in. It's annoying, and sometimes I even hear it, but to others she does it in this really soft, guilt-tripping voice. It's a problem because often, she's the problem and then she guilt-trips to turn it to look like she's saying that the people calling her out are just trying to make her feel bad. 

But Blue has never done any of this to me. When I'm around her, we talk about our futures and Star Wars. She jokes and memes a lot, but because we're not as close anymore, they aren't as funny. I avoid confrontation too so I almost never rebutt her points. Recently, she apologized to me about how poor her behaviour was back then, but I didn't understand what she was talking about. Now, I get it. But her behaviour wasn't just 'back then' either, it was also just a couple (maybe about two) years ago. Maybe even now, but everyone has probably already distanced themselves from her.

She also has this fake 'caring' voice that she uses around the people in her music group. She never uses this voice around me, but the music people all generally speak like that. The thing is, the 'caring' side to her is just like a mask, and the people who know her know that she's not usually like that. She has hurt their friends who don't deserve to be hurt, and for no apparent reason either.

I know that most of my friends feel uncomfortable bringing her up around me because it'll be something negative (I've never heard anyone who really knows her say something positive about her), but because of that I've been sheltered to how she treats her classmates. Another girl (Red) once said that while she was consoling a friend who didn't like to be touched, Blue came in, wrapped her arms around the sobbing girl and 'glared' at Red like one of those mean girls. Never have I ever heard something so cliched and dramatised, but unfortunately, I could definitely picture it.

When I'm around her, I definitely don't feel like her personality is weighing down on me, but I'm conscious of the connotations surrounding her. All the girls mentioned are also my friendly mutuals, so they don't associate me with her, as I'm generally polite, quiet and will crack a joke around them. I also know that Blue doesn't like people so when we were walking from our class, I'm worried that we'll bump into someone that doesn't like her or whom she doesn't like. So yes, I am very bothered about how people view her, mostly because there actually is something to dislike.

What should I do? Slowly back out of this friendship? Should I slowly doorslam her until the end of the year when our class is over? Should I just continue being her friend despite her bad behaviours? 

Two things: the stories are most definitely true, and I don't want Blue to know that I know about her being a bad classmate. I overheard these stories from reliable people.

[Serious] So i've been friends with this girl for around 4 years and we got really close for the past 1 year. I started having problems with other friends family and uni like 3 months ago. Basically a depressive state. And i started to treat this friend badly during these months. Sometime i would realize it and go ""sorry i've been treating you bad for the last couple of days because of etc etc"" And she always went it's okay i can understand you. For the last 2 weeks i realized that she started ignoring my texts and stuff. I waited 5 days for a reply to a single text. At the end i got mad and texted her again saying ""I don't know what to think of you anymore"" Then she replied to that with a long text blaming me for stuff and how i've changed, how we didn't get to know each other properly etc. and a few other stuff that she got completely wrong idea of. I replied with a long message explaining everything to her but she didn't reply to it. We haven't talked for a week. Today i wrote a handwritten letter to her and im planning to send it to her tomorrow. It's a 3 page long letter explaining how sorry i am, how i ruined stuff and telling how much i love her and how much i want her to forgive me. ( i know it sounds bad in sentence but it's actually a very touching letter ) Do you think i should send it? I'm actually afraid that she might not open the letter at all when she sees that it's from me. I really want her back and regret everything i did.",ND
169,"Was this a true friendship? TL;DR (?)
A friend that I have know for 15 years just blocked me on facebook. I have always had feelings for her but I had began to move on. I don't have a lot of friends and I always liked having her as a friend and as someone I could go to. She was willing to do this with me even when she was dating someone else. As she got more serious with the other guy she started to talk to me less and less and she started to not chat with me as much about her life but she always wanted to hear about my problems and woes.

I really started to feel that something was wrong when she recently got married. We had talked about marriage a few times in previous years. She had indicated that she was unsure if she would ever get married then she said she was considering it with her bf. Then one day she moved to a the same city as her husband to be but when I asked her about why or if she was considering marrying him she said she moved because she liked it there more. She hid the fact that she was engaged from me but still allowed a friendship. I know that it shouldn't have mattered that she was getting married but I did want to be supportive of it and I also wanted to know because I felt that it would be unappropriate for us to be the same type of friends that we were. One day I called her to tell her some really bad news about something that had happened in my life. I called several times but she didn't answer because she was busy. She finally returned my call at midnight and got onto me for calling her so much and then said ""I can't do this"". Then she put severe restrictions on it saying that  I could only talk to her in sever circumstances or to tell her things but she would never initiate contact with me or make small talk with me. I got fed up and told her that it wasn't true friendship if she wouldn't reciprocate communication or tell me about major things in her life getting married. I also brought up some things from the past that made me feel the way that I feel towards her. Then she blocked me on facebook and told me that she wanted to discontinue all communication altogether.

 I feel like she knew that she had be wrong with me in the past but refused to admit it to me. Was this ever a true friendship? Am I wrong for feeling like my heart was torn out because of what she did? Is what she did OK from her end? Was she wrong or could she have been better about communicating this with me? I just don't know how to process what happened and I feel bad but I still feel that if I am going to call somebody a friend, I should be able to talk to them about life without limitation. I do know there are boundaries but just making small talk shouldn't violate a boundary. I am just looking for validation.

I still do care about her as a person. I don't think she's evil but I do think that she doesn't have much  compassion for me.",ND

We both had an amazing Friendship of 6 years before that and there may not have been a single day that went by without talking to each other.. its like she became an integral part of my life..
But after she started to distance herself from the relationship I did keep bothering her which was a mistake on my part and I did apologize to her for that.. 
she kept blocking and unblocking me since then and I tried my best to get back our friendship as it matters to me more than a relationship as out of the few people who truly know me and are as important as the organs of my body she is one of them..
and as we know even without one organ a person feels Handicapped as I do now...

My objective is to seek positive experiences to better understand the foundational attributes of a functional family.  I believe, in fact, I know these families exist based on my South American experiences from an entire society but, what about North America? Families are families no matter the country you live in but, is the lack of family attributes / cohesion as a collective whole uniquely North American for many of us but, not all?

Hey guys, posting this on a throw away just incase.

Anyway, a bit of back story:
Me and this guy at work met because of our smoking habits. We both happen to smoke weed, so naturally we started hanging out together. It was all cool for a while, and then he started getting needy, trying to get whatever he could from me. He would ask for cash, ask me to buy him food, ask me for bud etc.

Then I found out by mistake that he is a meth smoker, which is something I do not agree with at all. He just became more hostile around me after this point (not physically, only slightly verbally/emotionally), so I decided to slowly break the tie.

So I started to ignore his messages and Facebook texts. I quit work btw (its been 6 months). He doesn't know where I live, but we both know that our town is very small. Basically everyone knows everyone here. So the chance of me meeting up with him in the future is very possible.

Anyway, as bad as all that sounds, I want to try and mend the relationship. What should I do?

The scariest thing is when I occasionally find, or think I find, her mental illness in myself.. certain tendencies to obsess, feel abandonment that isn’t real and lashing out because of it, etc. When that happens I just feel so disgusting and shameful.

180,"Best friend of 12 years seems to be drifting
When we were in middle/high school we were inseparable. I thought she was the most amazing person to ever walk the planet. She made me feel so smart, beautiful, special, etc...I loved her so much. We went through everything together during those times and when college came around, we went to different schools. I had to work 2 jobs to keep my head above water and couldn't always make the 4-hour drive to see her as often as I wanted. She also got into drugs, which was no issue with me, but since I was never into it, I stopped getting invites to places with her (probably due to the fact I always was ALWAYS working.) We both drifted a bit in college, but then afterward we (and our SO's) moved to the same city. I was so excited to finally have a better schedule and see her as often as I could. I told her how I found God after struggling with depression and anxiety and she immediately accused me of being homophobic because I said I was Christian (born again I guess, we both grew up Catholic). Which was severely not the case. She also accused me of being so different that it's like she doesn't even know who I am anymore. I let her vent about the drifting and the differences we both grew into since middle/ high school, without even mentioning to her that she was different too, it's called growing and changing as you age, but I still loved her just the same...then I expressed how I don't want to lose her over this and we eventually squashed the beef. I know she doesn't like my boyfriend of 5 years all that much, mainly because she thinks he changed me, not taking into account that I can make my own decisions and have my own thoughts that that nothing to do with my boyfriend's. 2 years go by and during those two years, her father passes away unexpectedly. He was the light in her life and it was so painful to see everything she went through during that time. I was there for her as often as she needed me and then some. Eventually, things started to feel really one-sided. I kept ignoring it because I knew she was grieving, but after almost 2 years, it was starting to get to me. My calls and texts were hardly received, she always seemed to be in a rush to talk to me, it felt like walking on eggshells. I guess now, what really bothers me is that a friend of hers is going through a hard time with her SO and my best friend has been extremely supportive and just going above and beyond with this other girl, while all I feel like I've received from her is criticism of my relationship, my values, my political views (which she really knows almost nothing about but assumes my position). As I write this, I'm actually getting angry at how much I've been there for her, but how little she has been there for me. I'm extremely scared to bring all this up to her because she is so critical and everything she says cuts deep. It's not a good feeling, but neither is this. I don't really know what to do, and I can't imagine losing her. I would hope I can work up the confidence to tell her how I'm feeling and we can have a rational conversation about it.

181,"[Need Advice] best friend (21f) moving in with my dad (dad age) and I (21f)
My best friend and I have talked about living together plenty of times. Now it’s really happening because her family is moving out of state and she has nowhere to go. My dad and I live in an apartment together and share expenses (though he pays for most of it). It’s a pretty good situation, but there are anxieties we both have about my friend moving in.
She is unemployed and has been for a while. The deal was that she could move in once she got a job (the deal was made like 7 months ago), but she is still jobless and her family is leaving in 3 days. We’re letting her move in, and luckily her mom is willing to help out with her expenses until she gets a job. But here are the worries:
• She had a lot of time before this to get a job, what if she takes even more time even after she’s moved in? My dad and I know from experience how difficult getting a job can be, but also expected her to have one by now.
The thing is, she’s very picky (even when she can’t afford to be). She won’t just take any job, she’s only applying to places she’d prefer to work at. Which I totally get! But at some point you just gotta do something even if you hate it, it won’t last forever and will even help you get to doing something you don’t hate. She’s repeatedly said that she’s “not the kind of person that can work a job she doesn’t like”. And that is definitely making it take longer for her to find work. But what can ya do?
• Another thing is, my dad and I (my dad especially) have had not-so-great experiences with friends/acquaintances moving in. That’s definitely made both of us have some not-so-great feelings about this situation (even if it may end up being really good!). A lot of things can ruin this and it’s hard to know how to avoid those things while still being a friend. It’s a thin thin line.
• my dad and I (my dad more than me) are also worried about compatibility. My dad and I get along great and it’s been no problem for us to live together. We have an unspoken agreement on bills, chores, privacy, etc. It just works. How can we keep that agreement while including a whole new person who might not think the same way?
For instance, I don’t know much about the way she lives. I know how it’s been with her family, but things are different when you leave home. It’s tough to say how it will be, but my dad is worried that she won’t be the kind of clean, kind, generous person he expects a friend/roomie to be. It’s tough because I agree with him..
• there’s the other matter of an official Roommate Agreement that could be made and signed by the 3 of us. We all think it’s a great idea, but I know how things can still get messy (literally and figuratively) when living with a friend. The problems that can arise are endless and maybe some even unavoidable. All we want is for things to work out well, with the least amount of issues as possible. Communication is key and that’s the goal of this Roommate Agreement.
However, there is still that line that we do not want to cross. I want this move-in to be professional as well as friendly. How can my dad and I make the rules clear so that she will take them very seriously without this being like some kind of crazy contract?

Thanks for even reading this!",ND
182,"Living At Home With Untrustworthy Family Member
This post may be a bit long, but I really need advice , outside of the obvious ""just move out"" , which I will be doing soon, but I need advice for until I do.

So I live at home with an untrustworthy uncle who has shown me that I can't trust him. He talks about people behind their back, personally talks down to me, purposely does things to hold me back (such as will place a setback in my way knowing it will affect my moving out --- he asks me to drive someone somewhere using my car during the time I have to be at work, ect.) .

Anyway,  my uncle wants me to contribute to the household by paying $50.00 towards the electric bill. So I go, ""Ok, no problem.""

That is a big problem because I was initially thinking I could go to a bill payment center and just directly pay it there as my debit card company (AMEX, Visa, ect) isn't accepted by the electric company. I called the electric company and was told if I go to a billpayment center that I need the bill or at least the account number. I have neither and am unable to access either because my uncle takes the bill . I have asked to see it, both asking my aunt and uncle. 
My aunt says ""I am trying to complicate things,"" and informed me that my uncle pays everything via his bank account,which really means to ""contribute"", I am really having to pay my uncle $50 after he pays the whole bill from his bank account. 

I don't want to do that because I am looking at having to give him that $50 , which is really going in his pocket, versus to the electric company, as a waste of money. I want to be sure my money is going where it is supposed to go (to the electric bill, and not in my uncle's pockets).  When my sister lived here, they let her have access to the bills and pay them or parts of them how she wanted.  We are two years apart, her being 28, and me being 26.  My uncle wastes a lot of money on hookah, and products on Amazon. He believes that my grandmother's house is his house (which is not true at all.) 

They, being my uncle and aunt are not allowing me to do things the way I want. I want to ensure that my money is going directly to the electric company in particularly because when I have contributed to the household as they (my aunt and uncle) have asked, I have watched my money be used in an unscrupulous manner and have had to deal with them (my aunt and uncle) basically monopolizing my time, so I can never progress with what I need to do in life, such as move out. My aunt tried to ask me how much money I bring in a month, and I refused to tell her. In my family, my family feels like if you are not forthcoming with information then something shady or bad has to be going on. In my case, that is not true. I am a young woman wanting to better herself and continue pursuing her passions (ones that actually will provide for myself and my OWN family --- children, ect if I have any) and leave a legacy behind when my time comes.  I am thinking not of just today, but later on down the line. 

My uncle is very immature. While his mother (my grandmother) was in the hospital due to a heart attack and stroke, he brought a random woman over and had sex with her in his mother's bed, and the girl was very loud and disrespectful considering that I am right down the hall. (Keep in mind, he has his own room on the third floor of the house where no one would be able to hear or see anything he is doing). He also has a superiority complex. 

My grandmother is still sick, and is supposedly coming home soon. I am trying to save so I can move, and have been the one helping my grandmother while she is sick. I am aware that I am dealing with a toxic family member (well, family members.) 

My uncle will downtalk me, calling me a bum, saying I don't have certain things, because he doesn't see where any of my money is at or goes (He isn't supposed to, I am a grown adult) , but at the same time, putting every road block in my way to keep me in a position where I can't get on better footing. I honestly feel my family just wants someone that they can talk about and put down. I have told my family that I don't have access to cash, so I can continue to save and move. I did say I can contribute in other ways. I have been the pariah of my family due to what a lot of people have said about me, lies and things that are untrue. I have family members that just want me to fail. I know that for sure.

 I have thought about waiting for next month's bill to come, and taking the account number off of it to directly pay my portion of the electric bill. 

To anyone who feels I may be being selfish, complaining , or lazy,  I am none of those things. I am currently working and saving money to move to another state. I was taught at an early age to trust my gut, and everything is all messed up right now. I have watched my family and am aware of how they operate. I don't want to be around people I can't trust. Family will betray you faster than your enemies.

So there is this girl I've been friends with for three years. Right now she is almost done with college but I still have to take some courses so we don't see each other that often. That's why she told me two weeks ago we should meet up. I told her to pick out the day which suit her best. She said Monday and I agreed. Turns out my mum needed money so I have almost nothing on me and because of that I told her I could hang out but couldn't go to the restaurant she said we should try. She replied that she ""couldn't make it tomorrow"" (today) and I thought wth?! you said Monday? It was you the one who said Monday not me... Anyway she said let's meet up on Wednesday and I said ok but tbh I don't feel like going out whatsoever. She was sorry because, and I quote, ""I thought we were going to meet today"" and I'm like dafuq. She, all of a sudden, forgot about it?! Does it make any sense? I guess she made plans with other people or whatever but fuck it, don't say one thing and then act like you didn't even say anything. I know I'm overreacting here but I'm so fucking tired of people and their ""you're my best friend"" and ""I love you, I care about you"" shit. The thing is I guess I'm pretty pissed off because I've always struggled to make friends but even when I have they don't give a shit. I'm so tired. Honestly, fuck everyone. ",ND

Sometimes, we take long commutes in the car with our toddler.

186,"Conservative republican parents &amp; liberal arts educated democrat child...what could go wrong?
I grew up in a poor household, but was able to use this to my advantage to get scholarships to private school and an elite liberal arts college. After graduating from school and coming back home, I realized that I have absolutely nothing in common with my parents anymore. They do not understand the concept of privilege, think everyone on welfare is lazy, voted for Trump and defend him and every time I get legitimately pissed off at them, they say that the school I went to brainwashed me and made me crazy and in doing so they completely invalidate all the hard work and effort I had to put in not only to get into this school, but working two jobs while there and still maintaining a 3.5 GPA. I was a sociology major, too, so these issues are literally what I spent most of my four years studying. It's now at the point where I cannot have a conversation with my father without it blowing up. It gets worse by the issue and the WORST part is that they are decent and loving people. Is there anyone else on here who is in a similar situation? What do you do? I'm slowly losing my mind trying to argue at this point. And moving out is the obvious solution, but I don't just want to run away from people who disagree with me and like, I don't pay rent.",ND
187,"How to deal with indecisive parents?
My parents are unbelievably indecisive. They make every single day about making a big decision about who moves to which country and it’s horrible. 

I’ve lived in New Zealand for almost ten years now, and three years ago my dad moved back to the UK for work. Every single day my mother asks me if she and my brother should go back and join him, and if so where am I going to live?

When I was 15 I was told we were moving to Australia. I had to report this to my dean and even had to say goodbye to all my friends, only to be told (and have to sheepishly tell my friends) it was not happening after all. Now I am 21 and it does not get any easier or less embarrassing. 

I was really excited when they promised to put me in a dorm at uni this year. I went to boarding school and loved it so I was really excited; my mum even took me to Briscoes looking for dorm equipment for me for Christ’s sake. They got me worked up like this for a good three months before telling me it’s not going to happen after all. I mean it would have been fine if they had not got the idea in my head. 

I can not take it any more. It is mentally exhausting and I have spent the past 6-7 years feeling powerless and anxious.

189,"Friend slipping up at work. I talked to her and now she’s creating a bad environment for me.
I’ll call my ex friend Mary.  We met at work.  I really valued our friendship because it’s hard for me to make friends.  I had a few hurt me in the past, so I became guarded.  Plus, I had to leave behind true ones when I moved away from my hometown 3 years ago.  About a year and a half ago, she started dating a new guy.  They seemed to have an ok relationship.  After a year of dating, they started having problems.  Mary spent every lunch hour complaining about him the entire time.  She stopped asking me how I was, always steering the conversation toward her bf.  I tried to be there for her, hugging her and reassuring her she’ll be ok.  She would be like, yeah I know but...then continue complaining about him.  She admitted to nagging him, and he eventually got sick of it and broke up with her.  She was a mess, crying at work, sometimes not even coming in.  I felt bad for her but it was the same thing over and over all the time, and I ran out of stuff to say.  Not to be offensive toward women (I am one, after all), but being the environment it is, word about Mary’s breakup traveled fast, and all our coworkers went up to Mary to comfort her. She leaned heavily on four of them, who often came up to her desk and asked if she wanted to talk.  Mary stopped hanging out with me and started spending a lot of time with them.  Mary would say yes when they offered to talk to her at work and they’d talk for like a half hour or longer (my desk is next to hers, so that’s how I knew).  I would also see Mary huddled in the hallways talking to these women a lot.  It affected Mary’s work.  She started taking on less work (claiming she was overwhelmed) and not being around (she would go off to find one of the women), so the rest of us would be left to answer her calls or speak to her clients on her behalf.  Our boss is very hands off and is a poor manager so he has no idea, and my coworkers just excuse Mary because they feel bad for her and don’t wanna tell our boss.  But because she and I handle certain cases that only she and I know how to deal with, it’s usually me who’s left to pick up the extra slack.  This went on for 3 months.  Honestly, if she wasn’t a friend, I might gone to our boss, but I decided to talk to Mary about it.  It didn’t go well. She got defensive, denied that she was slipping up, and accused me of being a bad friend cuz I wasn’t there for her during this difficult time.  I tried to point out examples of her slipping up and she denied it again.  I also told her she wasn’t there for me when my friend committed suicide or my dad had a health scare which left him disabled.  She just responded that she was left in so much despair from the breakup that she wasn’t capable of being unselfish enough to be a friend.  We both walked away mad.  She started ignoring me completely.  I didn’t think I was wrong but I still felt bad.  As this was around Christmas time, I decided to extend an olive branch by giving her a small Christmas gift and card that just said I was sorry and I hoped she had a merry Christmas.  The next day, she said thanks and we’d talk soon.  The day after that, she was back to ignoring me.  Now she doesn’t speak to me or even look at me, just pretends I’m not there.  I can’t say for sure, but I get the feeling that she told our coworkers about our conversation (I haven’t told anyone at work about it) cuz I now get the cold shoulder from some of them, too, when just the day before, we were all ok.  They, in front of me, make a show of hugging Mary and offer food to each other but not to me.  I even got a dirty look from one of the women, too.  Sigh, I don’t know what to do.  Any advice?",ND

Setting of this story is morbid but this is my favorite memory with my grammy.

I'm about to turn 22 and this took place back in November of 2017. My family lives all along Western Washington and we don't see each other often, so it was bittersweet to see everyone at my great grandmothers funeral. My cousins and I sat together at one end of the table when we all went to lunch after at a fancy restaurant with our moms next and then grandparents. Only two of us kids are old enough to drink, me and my 28 year old cousin. No one blinked an eye when he ordered an Irish coffee. But then the baby (me) ordered a rum and coke.

This resulted in two things.
1. My mom and cousin laughing at me because my original order was for Southern Comfort and coke and they said I drink  poor people booze (I'm 21 fresh out of college what do you expect)
2. My grandmother nearly had a heart attack when she even heard me utter that I wanted alcohol.

What made this even funnier was when I got my drink and she mentioned to my mom how she keeps forgetting I'm not 16 anymore.",ND

Whew, so my parents moved to America from Korea and had my sister and I. They still stick to their homeland culture and tradition, but I've become accustomed to how things are done in America. Where kids have privacy and all.
My mom has been pestering me to see me naked. She says it's to size me to buy bras, but I don't think so.
She invades my personal privacy a lot, like butt slapping and I sometimes catch her staring at my privates. She comments on if I'm wearing a bra or not and I find it kind of creepy. I get that it may be normal in Korean culture, but I've asked her to stop since I feel uncomfortable. She said no, simply because she gave birth to me.
Whenever I'm changing, she barges into my room barely even a second after knocking and stares at me when I'm semi naked. I asked her for some privacy, after all, I'm almost 13, but she rejects it.
My mom made plans to go to a public bathhouse, but I told her I don't want to. She wants to drag me out and ""rub all the dead skin cells off my back"" but I feel like she only wants to see me naked.
She recently got breast implants and keeps bragging about how she increased in size, and how she's regaining her youth. I'm happy that she is, but now I feel like she's shaming me for being flat. Hello? I'm 12. She tells me about how much bigger she was in comparison to other girls back then, then shows my sister her cleavage. I asked my mom if breasts define a woman, you know how she replied? Yes. If you want to fit in, yes. If you want to be able to wear todays modern clothes, yes. If you want to attract men, yes. I honestly LIKE being flat, but my mom says I'll change my mind. I respect the fact that I may, but I'm still sort of annoyed.
I think she just wants to see me naked. Not as a parent, but as an inspector. I don't know if it's exactly normal in Asian culture, but I feel extremely uncomfortable. Any advice? Sorry if I sounded sorta whiney.

I like my home to look nice when guests come over. Sometimes I’ll have a lightly scented candle on in the bathroom or hallway or I’ll turn on a lamp to light up my entryway. The kitchen is always set buffet style to make it easy for everyone to serve themselves. I always make sure to make my guest bedroom is welcoming. Like fluffy pillows, comfy comforter, extra linens, working tv. You get the idea. 

Whenever my FIL comes to visit it irks TF out of me when he makes these little adjustments while he’s here. I recently noticed that he’ll blow out the candle in the bathroom. Like WTF?! I know this cause I went in there before and after him once. He’ll also just randomly walk over to turn off my hallway lamp when he’s only been here for like 20 minutes. A few years ago, when he lived with us for a minute he rearranged my guest bedroom AND would rearrange everything around in my kitchen! I’m like wtf, I like my keurig right where it is! Thank you! 

Another wtf, we have a sectional that sits about 7-8 people comfortably when FIL/Bro IL come over they insist on spreading out and lay across the whole damn thing. Do they offer me a seat when I come over? No. It’s only until my bf scoots over to make room for me so I can squeeze in to sit somewhere at the end of the couch.

FYI he is NOT allergic to gluten and insists that “If the package doesn’t say Gluten Free it’s not gluten free.” Everyone knows not to start that argument with him,  there’s no point. Even if I mention that if my friend who has celiac disease can eat something it’s gluten free. He just shakes his head like idk what I’m talking about.

Awhile back I was out drinking with my aunt. She decided to tell me a"" huge family secret""  that my father was murdered by the guy my mom dated after he died. And that my mom was complicit. 

That my gramma and uncle , both dead now believed this too. That some doctor at the hospital said he looked as if he had been beaten to death. 

This pissed me off and confused me greatly since  my mother can't speak up for herself. She died  7 yr's ago. 

My aunt wasn't even there when my dad died in front if all us kids and my mom from an aneurysm when I was 2. 

This explains a lot about how I always felt me and my mom were outcast by my dad's family over the years. 

Yes my mom was a hippy and my dad's family didn't approve of her since she already had 4  kids when they married.

 Yes after he died she dated one of their mutual friends, who was black which they also disapproved of. 

That night riding my bike home from the bar I was crying and so confused praying to my mom and dad why would she say this to me? 

So i called my big sister/ best friend who calmed me down saying no, she was there, he wasn't murdered, my aunt just talking shit. 

My aunt  called me next day asking me not to tell my siblings what she said. She said she was afraid  the suspected murderer might come after her?! 

 Anyway by that time it was too late , but i didn't tell her that. I promised not to tell. I shouldn't have lied but the whole thing was just so bizarre I couldn't keep it to myself. 

My brother messaged her on FB that she was wrong, that he was there and saw everything , my dad was not murdered. 

The fact she would say that about my mom really upset all of us. 

Well since my brother messaged her, my aunt and my cousins completely ghosted me and my kids over the holidays and everything. 

Before then we were close travelling together and going to events and parties all the time. My kids don't get it. Where is auntie they say , can we go visit? I just say she's busy.

205,"In an awkward situation with my best friend. She wants me to tell how I feel towards her - how should I?
I’ve been friends with her for 3 years. She’s a lovely person and I really like her, but there were some occasions where I felt weird around her. 

She apparently sensed it and recently asked me what’s wrong between us, telling I should tell her if there’s something. 

Some of the things I’m thinking of telling her are:

- she often kind of invites herself when she learns I hang out with my friends and invites other people (that I don’t know well) as well without asking me when I organise something (picnic, trip etc.) 

- she’s a nice person and means well, but she sometimes says things that hurt my feelings. For example, she said she couldn’t wait to move into a new flat with her bf or how he’s like in bed when I was having a difficult time after a breakup, and she often assumes I’m broke and I feel sort of belittled. 

- she tells my rather personal stuff to her other friends, like gossip

I could list several things, but I’m not sure if I should be upfront, as she has social anxieties and I don’t want her to feel bad or scared in social situations. Or are there nicer ways to put them? 

Also, I should probably mention that I have a small circle of friends, and she’s basically been my only friend that I get to see regularly, I’ve been really good friends with a girl (B) that I met partly through her for the past few months. I enjoy hanging out with her (A), and we text each other all the time, but I’m not sure how she (A) feels about this.

206,"My friend refuses to pay his 600 dollar lost wager to me. What to do? [Long text]
One day, a friend and I started arguing about something. It turned into a heated but friendly discussion, and eventually we were both fed up with each other's differing views, so we both proposed a wager. We then spent the rest of the day simply arguing, but without any real conclusion, we decided to actually follow through with our wager. Before making the wager, we agreed on 600 dollars, and it was 100% agreed on from both sides.

Fast forward to him losing the wager and promising to pay me within a month or so when he would get his next salary. I also felt a bit bad about winning, so I decided to call him and ask him what he would have done in the exact same situation if the roles were reversed. He said he would have taken the money. Right then and there, I decided I would also then take the money, as my friend is (or so I thought) a man of honor. During no time did I ever say I didn't want the money from him.

Some time after I won, I made a little joke on facebook along the lines of: ""When am I getting my juicy money?"" with a little meme, as it would be awkward to simply tell him to pay me. He simply said: 

""I invested the money into [[fucking]] ethereum [[of all things he could have done]], and it rose 16%!
 
I probably won't pay you the money.""

I thought this was a joke, but later found out he was 100% serious. Of course this made me mad - not only that he wouldn't pay me all of a sudden, but also that he broke the news in such an arrogant way. I then argued with him, saying he owed me the money and we agreed on it as two men who made a very serious wager, both knowing what we would get ourselves into. I know for a fact that I would have paid him the second I would have lost, and I have told him so many times. He now claims that it is too much to pay, that it doesn't feel right (yet he also feels guilt) and that I am being negative and should just move on.

I get very mad at unjustice just like this, as could very well have lost the wager. I basically took a very unnecessary risk with this wager. I've told him I can't trust him anymore, but he seems to just want to move on, typing messages on Facebook like nothing has changed. He said he was sorry, but I don't accept the apology as he can still do what is right: pay me the money.

He tried twisting this on me trying to make me look greedy, when in fact he is the one who fucking scammed his friend. What is your view on this?

209,"Longtime close friend, brand-new bewilderment
My friend is distractable. He thinks irrationally. And he barely listens anymore.

I feel as though I've become a pane of glass or a mirror to him. When we're in a car together, he drones on about things (tell me if this has happened to you) he's told me many times before. Occasionally, in the middle, there's an admission: ""I probly told you this before, but.."". However, the story always continues, even if I briefly recap the story for him. When it's obvious the information has been shared, the most pressing imperative seems to be on reiterating it. Perhaps I didn't give the desired response the first time. I get the feeling he just doesn't care whether I'd like to hear it. I also possess conversational preferences, and they never include hearing the same story twice. After countless reccurences of this scenario, it seems that my considerations aren't really valued or remembered. Mentally, he seems to be on a train and passengers (myself included) are always bustling through and, as such, might just seem replaceable.

There doesn't seem anymore to be a genuine interest in my take on things. Questions are rarely asked, and if they are, they're poised in such a way as to elicit some agreeable response. We've never had a problem with differing opinions, but lately there is a marked disinterest in mine. If I express perhaps a different perspective I might share on something, he's typically halfway through deconstructing it and preparing a rebuttal by the time I've reached the bulk of my first sentence. Lately, I make sure to be concise. 10-word sentences. Brief, clear declarations with stipulations kept to a minimum. I do this in a sincere effort to make sure at least some of my thoughts reach him via this channel called speech. I feel a little like a sidekick, implicitly expected to go along with whatever is said or suggested and quietly supporting. I have needs and I make sure they're met. I just make sure, now, that they're met completely before I go into a conversation or endeavor with him.

The attention span has completely plummeted. He and his phone might as well have fused into one entity. Often times, when we're driving somewhere, or at our shared place of work, he will open a conversation. What he desires to be communicated is seemingly achieved. I give plenty of time, listening quietly and waiting a few seconds before responding. When I respond, sometimes I'll be surprised that I've been able to speak for a couple of sentences without being interrupted. Then, I'll look up and almost invariably, he's on his phone texting, on social media, or looking at boobs. I fall silent and look at him, stopping my speech, and sometimes there's a feigned response that hazily resembles some degree of mental assimilation. Other times, my input is simply ignored. I feel often that I am relegated to silence by virtue of necessity. What is the point of talking or even attempting to share with someone if they feel their device is more important than you? When there is no device involved, the listening is of such low quality that I feel as though I'm viewed as a shadow, or some reflective panel that occasionally flashes some piece of light which sparks a brief reaction.

I use the word reaction explicitly to differentiate from response. Responding, to me, would be careful consideration of the texture of the exchange. What I see falls on a spectrum between bristling and hyperenthusiastic. Everything in the observable behavior appears to come from an emotionally fueled place. I long ago ceased trying to appeal to logic and reason, because there seems to be a fantasy aspect to his formulations about reality, business, and essentially learning in general. An obstinate and vigorous type of chauvinism appears when the discussion involves logically based and scientifically supported criterion as pillars of discussion. ""Have you ever thought that maybe our ideas about science are just implanted by society, and another race has fully influenced our evolution as human beings?"" (to imply that the scrutiny intrinsic to the scientific community's assimilation of data is too dismissive toward fringe and pseudoscientific contributions). ""Physics is just one way to understand reality; there are physics we aren't even aware of that we won't know about for hundreds of years"" (as a soft excuse or rationale to discredit or invalidate the advances in modern physics and thus not include them in discussion). ""Can you prove to me that 1 + 1 = 2?"" (in a maddening conversation I had with him whereupon he elected to discredit all mathematics by attempting to upend the premise that numbers can accurately represent ideas).

I love math and physics because it helps accurately explain the world I live in. I can't share any of that enthusiasm with him, though, because his defenses rise as he falls lure to the siren of unreasonably ambiguous premises of belief. I get it; it represents flexibility and fluidity. There's no pinning someone 
down for their rationales or justifications if they honestly feel their ideas reside above the established and fair principles of unbiased scientific criticism. The implication seems to be that it's a lot more fun and even more reasonable to live in the dark, because anything a person makes up could be true, and the absence of scrutiny works synergistically to provide disincentives for the need for proof.

We have been friends since third grade. We're both in our thirties now. We've remained close and shared lots of valuable experiences. Emotionally, we're there for each other and that's always what we've been best at. But I feel this insistence on the employment of a deductive philosophy of thinking which ignores outside criteria in favor of ""empathetic"" consult has wedged a chasm between us. I can't really tell if it's me or him whom has done the most changing in the last few years, but rest assured, I am working at a 100% level of effort to rectify what issues there are and reforge our understandings.

A personal aside:  Three years ago, I experienced a rather significant mental shift. I began to make efforts to look at the world more objectively, understanding better how I was not the focal point of existence. I took myself down a few notches, and in doing so, became irrevocably drawn to learning about the finer workings of the world in which I lived.  During this time, I had the pleasure of working with a young man seven years my junior with whom I could seemingly achieve no middle ground. Even just a casual extended conversation seemed unbearable. We came from different places and really just resigned ourselves to tolerating one another. For a long while, I just couldn't put my finger on what bugged me about the guy. Then, about six months in, it hit me: I was unable to reasonably share anything I had learned, without it being scrutinized needlessly by way of the contrast of his own biased interpretations. The scrutiny itself didn't bother me; it was the nature of the uncredentialed and entitled rebuttals. They had little basis in scientific sourcing and did not stand stand up well to criticism. The young man's ideas about the world were essentially all based on his own experience, and there appeared to be no real desire in him to contrast those findings with a collective reality outside of his own.  I eventually came to realize I didn't like the kid because he reminded me of me.

From that point on, I vowed to observe my thought processes more closely. The last thing I wanted was to waste someone's time unwittingly by spewing nonsensical garbage of which I had no demonstrable proof or understanding. I read about using proper reasoning and recognizing logical fallacies. I worked to become more mindful toward my own irrational inclinations. It became tantamount to recognize the ignorances and defenses to which I'd become accustomed to clinging, and replace them with the collective wisdom provided by my new best friends: logical and rational thought. As I was doing my best to employ these utilities, I figured I could scarce be assumed a fool and reasonably sort out those ideas which did not hold up to proper scrutiny.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, this new method of articulating reality didn't win me many friends. The good ones I've retained, and those who didn't share this unearthed enthusiasm for inductive reasoning were left behind. This friendship I share with this person seems like a relic of the past me. I don't believe he's shared the same monumental changes in mental processing. He's always had a certain flair for exaggeration and fantasy, and until recently, I just accepted it as face value and dealt with the occasional misunderstandings as I'm sure he had with me. Now, however, the implications seem more pronounced. He's running a business and is constantly distracted. The time we share is often saturated by ramblings of fanatical pseudoscience or mysticism which are 
impossibly asserted and employ mind-numbingly irrational justifications. The only discipline seems to be that of a zealous allegiance to the fortification of the shared psychological concoctions of the hopefully ignorant. There is little point in rebuttal anymore because, deductively, the answer has already been solved for. And rest assured, 1 + 1 = 2 was not used in this equation.

If indeed there is a future for this friendship, at least on my half, it involves intensely disciplined patience. I feel sometimes like a social worker, intently listening and softly steering the delinquent in a healthier direction. I meditate and identify as Buddhist. I consider myself to be a spiritual person, and I understand that my interpretation of reality is uniquely pixelated in ways that differ from those of others. I work to cultivate higher compassion and practice patience and kindness when I feel a bristling within myself or witness a bristling in others. As such, I feel that just living my values and being a good listener might be the way through this. I can't help but feeling, though, that this is the beginning of a fork in the road which leads to an increasingly fainter sense of collective recognition.",ND
210,"How To Get Over The Pain
I ended/lost a friendship with a best friend of 14 years. She was really good to me, once upon a time; I was declared disabled and lost my house and she let me move in with her and her husband to get back on my feet. For all she knew I could've been the Thing That Never Leaves. But I lived with her for about 9 months, got a job, and got my own place.

She's Mormon, and during this time had her first kid. She insists everything's fine, no worries (because she had to, I think; Mormons put a lot of pressure on their women.) But things start getting distant between us, and this is only something I notice in hindsight.

I got the greenlight to publish a book, and she offered to typeset because she had InDesign. Okay, are you sure? Yes. You're sure? Yes. Okay, cool, thanks, that's awesome, I don't have to do it myself cause I don't have the program or know how to use it. I give her a deadline for October and pay her.

Well, I bust my ass on this book for months. It's the most important thing I've ever done with my life and it means everything to me. And 4 days before deadline, I find out she's only done up to Chapter 5 on the book. Which basically means she fucked off for 4 months, and did nothing, which means she's going to do a rush job. That automatically means more mistakes that I have to depend on her to fix, which she didn't in the first place, and she's totally shattered my trust.

I freaked the fuck out on her and had a hysterical meltdown. It was bad, and I don't make any excuses for it. I was really shitty to her. I panicked and thought she was going to hold the book hostage with procrastination, and I had no way to get the files from her. I'd put myself up shit creek, because it was too late for me to learn InDesign.

Well, she was defensive, to say the least. She said I don't need to police her time, and I should've known this is how she works. I felt like she was trying to gaslight me, so I posted on Facebook about the situation without naming names and asked other professional artist friends if this was appropriately professional behavior. They said no. That REALLY pissed her off, because a few days later I got a letter.

In it she said she'd done all this stuff for me (let you live in my house, put up with your shit etc.), said I didn't want her to have her dream family and dream life (she was doing horse archery competitions and I didn't want her to do that, either, apaprently), my shitty upbringing made me dysfunctional, and she gave me an ultimatum that I had to make a change. Until then she said she didn't want me to talk to her, and she was ""closing her door to me.""

I felt supremely judged, i.e. ""My perfect Mormon family was NEVER dysfunctional, so obviously you're the problem here, as a dysfunctional person yourself. Not me."" I felt like I'd been un-forgiven, ""Hey, remember all that stuff I said I forgave you for? Surprise!"" And I felt horrible, like I could never apologize enough, and that from here on out I was going to be scapegoated because I was the fucked up one and she was the squeaky-clean Mormon.

I left her alone for about 6 week, not talking to her like she said. Then I reached out, apologized, and asked if we could talk in person without anymore nastygram letters. And this, to be honest, is where I'm most mad at myself, because I wish I'd just cut things off the minute she started talking like her shit didn't stink. Instead, we met, and she said my apology made her angry because it sounded like I'd disregarded her letter. I was a bit taken aback, because the letter sounded like one of those venting things where you're supposed to write them but not send them, and instead she was acting like she'd sent me gospel I needed to abide by.

I said I felt like I was always going to be the wrong one, no matter what. She said I came from a dysfunctional family, compared me to a fear-agressive dog, and said ""Which problem is more in need of fixing?"" So in other words, yeah. Yeah, I was always going to be wrong, because no matter what she did I was always going to be worse because of my background. She said I'd declared her typesetting ""a failure"" before I even saw it, and insisted she'd done a good job. I told her there were obvious mistakes, like misaligned tabs and words running into illustrations, and she said she'd made the deadline and reiterated that once again, I should have known she procrastinates. I told for someone who had gone to church for twenty plus fucking years, she didn't know how forgiveness works because Jesus doesn't say ""Forgive thine enemies, until you've got a whole pile of ammunition and can really use that shit against them."" (I'm agnostic.) She said she'd already apologized (implication being that I couldn't forgive) and when I told her it felt like she could never make a mistake, she screamed ""YOU JUST WANT ME TO GROVEL!"" and stormed off. Her husband came out, yelled at me, and told me to ""handle my shit"" and called me a toddler. Previously he'd admitted to me in private that he wouldn't hire his own wife for a job because of her lack of professionalism.

The next day I wrote her saying I needed my book files, to make sure the publisher could make corrections. And once that was good to go, I told her I was glad we weren't friends anymore, because all her judgement was off my shoulders. She said she would have fixed the typesetting mistakes if I'd just told her, DURING the time she'd explicitly said not to talk to her, so it was my fault again for not getting things corrected. I was arrogant, you see, and she said she wasn't angry, just that she felt sorry for me, and told me ""You are your family.""

I am genuinely glad to not be friends with her anymore. She made the worst of assumptions about me, turned on me when SHE fucked up and made it MY fault, and got hyper-defensive and toxic  in her behavior while simultaneously calling me dysfunctional. Hindsight is 20/20, and I feel like she had too much to do with her baby, couldn't say no, and resented the task in the first place. She said she didn't come home every night and think ""I'm not going to work on typesetting tonight, just to piss off Plethora"" as if good intentions can't pave the road to hell and hurt people. I said we were shitty to each other, but she won't admit fault at all. And I know I don't need a judgemental perfectionist in my life.

But I'm still hurt, and outraged, and angry. I keep finding myself having arguments in my head when I'm driving or trying to fall asleep. I'm furious that everything became conditional suddenly, that I was retroactively unforgiven, and treated in the worst way by someone who sees themselves as morally superior. Winter is just finishing up so I haven't really been able to get out fo ra Meetup or something, but it's hard not to fee like you can't make a relationship work when a 14 year one just went down the drain because of something you did. I've read some other Reddits, where people have lost friendships over things like weddings, which make me feel a bit better. Bitching someone out because they dropped the ball on your creative work suddenly doesn't seem so unreasonable. But I'm mad I tried to make things work even after a bunch of red flags telling me I should've known better, and STILL ended up feeling like shit because I ""apologized wrong"" and ""wasn't good enough."" I miss who my friend used to be, not who she is now. I feel like the only thing that's going to take away the pain is time, but it's been months and I still feel the same way, and feel like I'm justified in never trusting anyone again, because if 14 fucking years aren't enough, what is? How do you get over the pain of things ending so badly when part of it was your responsibility, too?

211,"Is this my distorted reality?
Okay, I almost always run into this problem with friends, and I'm not sure how to get out of the situation without feeling guilty or ashamed of losing yet another friend.

Situation One
There's this friend whom I helped many times and every single time other people bashed me, she would either laughed with other people or further ridicule me.  Things like asking me to fix her phone, helping her find a place to rent, providing her with advice on many issues...

I have since asked her not to further ridicule me, and her response was, ""oh this is not what I do, but I would like to remain friends with you because you are a resourceful person and you see things differently."" I kind of ghosted her after I graduated from university, but I always wondered whether I handled the situation appropriately.  She always tries to avoid me in public space, but when she gets into a car accident, she would call me and ask for help.  I am neither interested nor in love with her.  I actually felt she might be in a hopeless state, that's why she wanted my help.  

SCENARIO TWO
I have this friend who always makes weird implication towards how stingy I am.  They made assumptions about my contributions to me and my SO and said things like, ""Oh, if given the opportunity, would you kill [so's name] and claim his insurance policy"", ""You know greedy people normally turn out to be the poorest bunch in the population right?"".  The fact is, I have been contributing to the relationship between my SO, my SO is older than me, so in a way, my SO is more financially independent.  At times when SO is helping me out, I always mark the number down so I know how much I owe SO [actually he calculated the amount and sends me invoices].  But I won't disclose such details to my friends.  I am just disappointed as to how people assume things and the last thing I want is to be the victim in every f*ing relationship.

Is there something I am not seeing here, is there a problem with how I am handling the situation well?",ND
212,"I want to convince my family to repair my phone instead of buying a new

213,"Need advice on a friendship!
Need advice on a friendship!So I’ve written on here a few times about this crush I had on this straight guy I worked with at work for a little over 6 months or so. To summarize it, in those short months or so we became friends I guess u can say. We both are a year apart, he likes sports, music, and video games, etc. Anyways I developed a crush on him and I couldn’t handle the fact it would never happen, so I said to myself to try and make this friendship something memorable. We hung out 3 times outside of work, the third time was kind of quick but it was still outside of work and it happened last Friday, which I loved not only was I trying to catch up with him since we hadn’t hung out since December and it’s already March. So to put in perspective, I know it’s long but bear with me, it seems like our friendship is awkward at time, there’s long silences in between, don’t really have much to say. I mean for me it’s hard already hard enough for me to engage in a long convo, I’m sort of shy but I’m trying to break out of it, and don’t really have much to say, it sucks because I feel like I’m ruining a friendship that could be great. He kind of has the same personality when I’m with him. I don’t really have many friends well because they’ve all have been assholes to me, so I really don’t have many people to talk to when I want to. So what do u guys of my friendship with this guy? Is it me or do u think it’s complicacted? Just another one I don’t I ever receive text messages from him saying what’s up or checking up on me. Now take for granted he might have a lot of friends so idk. I’m usually the one who texts first",ND
214,"Ending a friendship (This post is insanely long FYI)
I have a mate [17M, nearly 18] whose currently in a relationship with a girl [just turned 16] that he is completely infatuated by. He buys her stuff constantly, despite his financial situation (more on that later) and does lots of other things (also more on that later).

This friend of mine completely revolves his life around this one girl. He once told me he would do anything for her and that he would kill himself if they broke up (he's also depressed, which I think he should fix before even being in a relationship but it's too late now) he also said he would feel 100% responsible if she were to kill herself (she's not depressed. It was hypothetical. When I told him it wouldn't be his fault as everyone is responsible for their own actions, I simply received a ""shut up"". There have been many incident like this where I've truth bombed him and he's stuck his head in the sand and might as well be saying ""lalala I can't hear you!""

Unfortunately for my mate, these feelings don't appear to be reciprocated. He buys her gifts all the time, even though his mum can barely afford fuel due to her unemployment and the fact she's a single mum. He bought her a bath bomb and perfume and other stuff for her birthday (would be upwards of $50 (Australian dollars btw if that's even a concern) from a family that sometimes has $0 in their bank account when he didn't even get anyone else (including me) a gift for our birthdays. The girl doesn't even seem phased by his financial situation or his depression. If she cared, wouldn't she ask to not have gifts to help him out?. Not to mention that she hasn't bought A THING for my mate. In real life they seem like a stable couple but it's much worse. 

The mate also purposely neglects invites from his mates (including me) for her. We invited him to see Star Wars: The Last Jedi and he messaged her about how he didn't really want to go (me and a mate broke into his Snapchat account. His iPad charger is broken and he can't afford another one so he gave us username and password to Snapchat so we could do his streaks which apparently matter. Also this is another testiment to his financial situation. Can't afford a cheapo third party cord for his iPad)

We looked through his messages and pretty much he's sending ""almost nudes"" thankfully with consent and a thotty dog filter picture (even though he would call anyone else that did it a thot to fit in) he also constantly asked to call on discord to which she replied only with ""sorry"" or ""can't"". No explanation whatsoever. Her friends are also incredibly irresponsible (thankfully he sees through that)

When my mate is talking to me or anyone else. All we get is a bombardment  ""what if she doesn't like me"" and other relationship jargon. I don't care but I have to pretend to. He cannot talk about anything else ever. It's just relationship this relationship that. I'm sick of it.

When he was at a very dark time in his life, me and 3 of my mates (2 girls including the girlfriend and one guy) made a group chat to talk about how we help him. We all talked very in depth except for the girlfriend. My mate asked her ""what do you think of all this were talking about (we went very in depth into his situation) to which her response was ""I don't know"" after saying NOTHING. 

I'm sick of his ignorance. I'm sick of him neglecting me and the other lads. I'm sick of it all. He even tried to seize control from his girlfriend. She went to hi five me and he said ""why are you bringing him over here"" in an incredibly annoyed tone"" 

I know I'm only the ""when Chloe isn't present talk to him isntead"" guy. He doesn't care. 

How do I cut him out of my life whilst causing the least ruccus possible?
(I have 2 other friends who have identical opinions so if you offered advice I'd be able to tell them too)

If you have anything I need to clarify please ask and I will do so. I typed all this on a phone so it's kinda hard.

215,"My dad says I'm careless but does nothing himself
Basically my dad came into my room tonight saying that my mom over heard me and my brothers conversation. (we were talking about how hypocritical he is)

He started to get really mad and started yelling at me because I never do anything the right way or enough.

I usually go out to eat so Im like never in the kitchen, when he comes I to my room and starts  screaming at me because I don't help around the kitchen I'm to scared to tell him that neither does he.... For example he had left his hot dog mess, rice mess, and his dishes in the living room all for us to clean up. Generally my mom would pick  up after him and clean up but she is recovering from an injury that was quite serious. So when he comes into my room and yells at me, exaggerating the problem emmensly, for not helping out, I just want to scream in his face that he doesn't do anything and I'm always picking up after him... Continuing to tell me how careless and irresponsible I am. 

I get that I'm not perfect and I do forget some stuff but it just seems like I baby him and I get yelled at if I don't clean up after him.... Someone help me, how can I tell him that he's needs to clean up after himself! ",ND
216,"My friend wants to use my house, so she can be alone with her boyfriend. Should i let her?
So, my friend's got a boyfriend. They're in the ""lovey dovey"" phase right now, and they really want to consummate their relationship, i think they should wait until they're 18, but it's their choice to make.


Anyway, my conflict is this. They want to have sex, but they have nowhere to do it at. They're too poor for a hotel, and both their parents watch them like hawks whenever they're together. Plus, she gets taken too and from school, and her parents chaperone her everywhere else, since she doesn't have a car yet (they are making her work for her vehicle). As for him, his dad never leaves the house, and he has an ""open door"" rule, meaning they have to be where they can be seen and all doors open at all times at his house.


The only time her parents aren't watching her is when she's with me, we hang out a lot on the weekend, so they let her spend the night at my house often, because of my situation on the weekends.


On the weekends, my mother works late evening/nights, and she's gone until almost 6 in the morning. My father is sometimes their on the weekend, but he's often away, for months at a time (he's a trucker), he's gone right now actually. (THey let her stay with me so i can have company at home, when my parents are gone)


So, i'll be alone this weekend. Earlier today, her boyfriend came up to me and asked if they could ""do the deed"" in my house this weekend while my parents are out, he knows of my situation as well. They both want this, they practically begged me. I told them i would think about it.


So, should i allow this?",ND
217,"My Best Friend Feels More Like My Daughter
I love my best friend like family and if anything were to happen to her, you can know I'd be there in an instant. But I feel awful admitting that I really don't like spending time with her anymore.

We're both in our late twenties and I'm sort of the only family she has since she severed ties with her parents (a choice I completely agree was for the best). We've been best friends for the past decade and I've seen her through some really difficult times.

She's faced a lot of struggles, mostly stemming from the terrible relationship she had with her family and the financial burden separating from them put on her life. Unfortunately, many of those struggles are ongoing and have really dominated our friendship. We spend more time talking about her problems than we do hanging out.

I've gotten up at 3:00am to talk with her on the phone because she had a nightmare and she's scared. I've left my job early to go help her because she left hers early in tears. Days that are supposed to be fun (a movie, a game night, making dinner together) end up with me supporting her because she's upset about something, and suddenly the whole evening is gone. I don't want to exaggerate, but I'd say 70% of the times I see her I have to go into ""support mode.""

And unfortunately, I've realized that I don't enjoy her as a friend and I honestly don't think I ever will again. The dynamic of our friendship has changed and it's never going to be what it was. Don't get me wrong, I care deeply for her and want to be there for her if she needs me, but the fact of that matter is I've found myself not reaching out to her anymore because it's just not a pleasant experience. When we do hang out, it's not because I want to; it's because I feel that's what she needs. She's a burden. She's a burden I bear willingly. But she's a burden.

I don't know what to do. I really wish there were an easy way to say ""I don't like you anymore, so please don't be hurt that I don't reach out, but god you don't know how much I care about you.""",ND
218,"Lifelong friend keeps lashing out
So I have this friend, she's my best friend and have been forever. ?We've been friends since we were 2, we traveled the world together. We're now 25.
She's been through a lot, difficult family stuff, life isn't easy on her at all and her entire life is struggling. Honestly, she needs me. Without me she'd be pretty lost and she knows it. I pretty much take the mothers role. Her mother isn't there (and usually she's more destructive than anything) and I do a lot of the stuff mothers do, including being her punching bag.
Because of all of this, she tends to be very impulsive and when she's upset she can say stuff that are very hard for me, like she can get upset with me and then say mean stuff, and that she wants me and everyone else to f-ck of and leave her alone, sometimes worse. It doesn't sound too bad but when it happens repeatedly from a good friend when you try to help her it's really really hard.
Every time I have to tell her that it hurts me, I have to practically beg her to say sorry. Eventually she breaks down and says she's so sorry and that she can't control herself. I always forgive.
The thing is I know she doesn't mean it. And also I know she's naturally impulsive. But also I don't think she's really trying to control it. I know she's got so much on her plate that it's natural to lose control and not be able to always control everything, but it's really hard for me even though I know she doesn't mean it. 
Right now I honestly don't feel like I want to talk to her. I think the fact I ALWAYS forgive makes her not really try to control it. She lost dozens of friends because of it but she know I will always stay.
Right now I just feel like telling her that it's been one time too much (I've warned her before that eventually I might just unwillingly break), and that I can't take it. I forgave her probably over a hundred times, seriously. And I honestly care about her, and I honestly know she doesn't mean it, and I honestly worry that without me she won't be able to survive. But also I just can't stand being a punching bag anymore, it's emotionally exhausting and I feel drained. I don't know what to do anymore. I can't live my life like this but I can't live my life knowing that my leaving ruined her, which really might happen. ",ND
219,"Accidentally kissing my friend after a party, what did i fuck up
So there's this situation that happened once a week or two ago that kind of made my pretty-close-but-not-best friend dude friend feel...distant? I'm not sure but it coincides with the event and theres this subtle awkward ""accidentally"" distant attitude i feel coming from him, though I apologized for the kiss the very same day by text, that happened the morning after i slept in his bed at his party (we were 5 friends chatting in his bedroom until 6 am and the others left but we fell asleep spooning. madeout when we woke up. He has a girlfriend whos super jelly and absolutely doesnt want him to mess around, even tho he cheated on her a few weeks ago without telling. I have a boyfriend of 2 years that i love as well but we have a history of cheating on eachother and not knowing how to end this. 
POINT IS, i really wanna have sex with my friend right here. Once or whatever, i don't really care, but i want my hots to go away and while hes only generically attractive, with very bland taste in women (im bisexual af and i don't understand most straight men tastes alright) , hes really more than that and has some kinks i share. Plus, everyone has had some sort of relationship or hookup with eachother in the past in our friend group, and him and I are the only pair that hasn't, so thats kind of anpther thing that makes the idea awkward. Not bright. I don't know what to feel about this.
I slept in his bed again last night after an intimate party with our friends because the guest room was busy. At some point I was pretty sleepy and felt his hand on my panties (i didnt have pants on because its uncomfortable), but he was well asleep. I gradually felt a tingling growing round there and it slightly woke me up, and after some time he was starting to give me hand stuff, leaned in to kiss me, and then - maybe it was because i didnt bring my toothbrush and had bad breath, i hope not for the love of god, a few seconds after that he removed his hand from what i literally had been dreaming -fuck my life for making me that horny, grabbed my boob a little and then got his hand back to him and fell asleep. I dont know why he stopped, and thats the most awlward thing : what could that mean? If we had full on sex we could both agree it was wanted but a mistake, and reveal sexual tension between us. But right now it looks like i dont really attract him at all, but he still likes some intimacy, just not with me. Is that your analysis as well? What do you guys read in this? 
Im well known for liking girls and have  short jaw length cherry red hair. A very cute face but Basically not your typical bombshell. Maybe that's what differences me from other girls he would dig having sex with? 
Otherwise...im just lost. I have no way of finding out if hes attracted to me in the slighest at the moment , and if we're not meant to bang, i really feel like we lost this kinda vibe in the past months where he would randomly text me every few days and have long, intimate convos about feelings and things happening in our lives, even if were not best friends, we got along well. (We dont really hang out alone together though, that might have happened once or twice only) I really hope i wont lose this definitely from those two awkward, unwanted situations(?) , it would really suck cause I really like him as a friend.

220,"Reddit, need your help on restoring friendship
Hello there, dear redditors. I truly need your advice and every opinion is highly appreciated, so feel free to express whatever's on your mind. I'll try to keep things as short as possible, so here's the problem. I know a friend of mine since we were 7 and now i'm 23. Recently (for a month or two) i started allowing new people in my life, which is pretty unusual for me and it got so overwhelming and intense that i didn't notice i started building distance with my best friend because i concentrated on new people too much. Eventually we got so far from each other that we barely even talk. We still respect each other and are chatting on occasion trying to look like we're still those ""good old friends"", but i can tell that he's not okay with the situation, even despite he's trying not to show me that. I know i fucked up big time. He's my best friend that has always been there for me and i won't forgive myself if i'll lose him. So, reddit, what do i do? I know it would be the best just to tell about the situation, but i can't find proper words and it pains me. Thanks in advance.",ND
221,"Alcoholic dad
It's been like this since I was 6 years old. Just to give information, my family and I lived on a farm before I was six and I rarely got into contact with people outside of my family so I barely knew how to talk and would rather screech and be mad all the time and this led me to be very bad at my own language and have few ""real"" friends. My dad's problem started when he started drinking after the company he worked in shutdown I didn't know about it but my family fought about it without my knowing and I don't even know my siblings that well due to me never having gotten any real attention I just sat in my room while they fought at age six and played a game of Madagascar and shut it out I started understanding at age 10 how bad I was with actual relationships i barely know even now how to initiate discussions with other people or relatives and cryed, everyone started to fight at age 11 now at age 16 my dad drove me and my friend from my other friends due to us having had a LAN (played games) and he almost drove right into the railing of a bridge and that was today now that it wasn't just me who was endangered because of his fucking problem I started getting mad. He barely cares what I say and what my mom says he probably wants to leave my mom but doesn't have the financial expertise or job to do so. I dont know what to do and I barely have the guts to cut myself or anything just banging my head into a wall when my parents aren't home or watching people play games. If you read this whole thing thank you. My dad had gotten physical a few times as well. 

Sorry for the wall of text.",ND
222,"im lost without her but I don't know what to do
So me and my best friend of about 7 years stopped talking and being friends essentially, around a year ago. We had been fighting a bit before and it kind of led up to this.

So what kind of started it off was the fact she got a new boyfriend who was and I swear still is, the biggest jerk of all time. I can see now that it probably wasn't my place to tell her that but I was only looking out for her and she used to appreciate advice like that from me in the past. 

Then she started pretty much ditching me for him and taking his side and telling him things that were private and I felt like she was slowly kicking me out and replacing me. And I told her that, but she didn't see it because she had her new guy and it was kind of like she didn't care because she had someone there for her.

She also lost a couple other friends before this happened pretty much due to the same reasons so I didn't feel that bad at first because I was kind of like you know ""she did this to herself, she made this choice"". But now, I really miss her and I hate that we stopped being friends because I kind of need her.

Im not sure what to do. She did actually text me about a month after we stopped talking and was like ""hey, I know we don't talk anymore but I wanted to see how you are going"" and I actually ignored it because I was angry and didn't care but now I kind of see it was a bitch move. And I don't know how to text her or talk again because its awkward and she's still with this guy and I'm pretty sure he hates me and I juts don't know how to handle it. But I really want to make this right again.

Any help would be really appreciated :)

223,"Too cowardice or just selfish?
So English is not my first language so there might be some grammar mistakes but this has been bugging me for a while now.
There was this girl I met some time during my last year of middle school and I guessed she took an interest in me, I was pretty confused as I wasn't the type to stand out much and I wouldn't talk at all unless someone comes up and starts a conversation with me. And she was the one to do that - uh, during a school graduation ceremony, of course. After that, we went to different high schools but still kept in touch.

So overtime, after the graduation, we kind of became close, as friends. Well I didn't have many friends to start with so I spent a lot of time talking to her about all kind of stuff and I was devoted, if she was sad I would spend my day trying to cheer her up or yes, I wouldn't push her to say what was on her mind if she didn't want to share but yeah, I could do anything to make her happy because as I said before, I didn't have many friends, I was bullied and she was the first one to be so kind to me - all my ""friends"" kind of just sided with the bullies when they knew I was the target. At one point, I thought I was in love with her. But that was the part I would feel guilty whether it came up, I thought because she was the popular type, and she had a boyfriend, dating her was something I could never do. But then she broke up with her boyfriend (it was some kind of argument over some disagreements iirc), I was happy about it but it just wasn't the right time, she was sad and she would spent the whole summer the following year after we met just talking with me about stuff and as we could do some drawings, we kind of made a world of our own and we would stay up until 2 in the morning everyday just to think of a concept for that universe (it's like making a comic or something, I'm a big nerd for world concepts) so it was like I was bonded with her. Anyways I think I'm being too informative about this so I'll just skip to the main point. After that, about 6 months or so I tried to be an understanding friend and I didn't take a single opportunity to try to flirt with her as I knew I would be a dick if I had done that - well because I thought I shouldn't pressure her into a relationship whereas she just got out of one.

So anyways, after a year, she got over it, I thought it was the right time for me but I didn't have the confidence to confess because I was overprotective of her as she didn't/doesn't have a good family and I was more like a big brother to her, because she was the one who wasn't good with dealing problems and I've lived my whole life dealing with all kinds of problems so I had a good view of dealing with them (I won't go into details as it would be another really long story) - So the idea of us dating was kind of ridiculous - I still don't know if she ever felt the same way. So I tried to change for the better, I went out to socialize more (it was exhausting but hey, there are things you would do for love), I worked out to lose weight so she doesn't feel embarrassed if we were to get together (she doesn't say it but I know she doesn't even want to date a fat guy) - I wanted to be a good partner for her, I know I wouldn't be the best but I could try. I tried to be someone reliable because I know full well she kind of looked down on me, how she tried to prove that she's better than me at everything (she is, at some fields). But the distressing part was that she started changing, she is still popular (yup, up until now), but she had more outbursts, she was constantly crying and whether I came up to ask her what was wrong she would throw a fit at me so I thought I was invading her privacy too much so I didn't say anything anymore, I was just there, trying to be supportive. So for the second time, I let go of another opportunity for a girlfriend.

(you can actually skip the first two parts but I just felt like going into details, sorry)

The third time, I thought it was time to make a move and she met a girl and fell in love with her instantly, I was supportive of her regardless. The latter one was also attracted to her so I thought just what kind of person would be so selfish to stop their bestfriend from getting in another relationship. I mean, honestly, I never had any luck with girls so I could just wait for later, her being happy was my priority. Yeah, so ever since I tried to change, I was better at talking. So I helped them get together, how to reply just to get the other one to be her girlfriend. And after that, our friendship was getting better. I thought I was the happiest person at the time, but another part of me was devastated. That part was well hidden for quite some time but it grew, it hated her girlfriend, it hated the fact that I was being too devoted and never got anything in return (I didn't quite expect anything in return from the start but I guess my feelings piled up). And before I knew it, I was being a control freak, I hated the other one not out of jealousy, but rather because she brought her down - her girlfriend was suicidal, she kept saying how she wanted to die - well I could careless about that because I knew lovers don't like bestfriends. That is, until she started saying how she wanted to die, she was constantly whining, crying and whether I asked her she just said nothing was wrong and kept on doing so. And whether I tried to talk some sense into her she just replied with a single ""Ok."" and it was bugging me. And she spent most of her time talking to her girlfriend and kinda just went anywhere with her, I never knew what was going on in her life anymore at this point. Now I'm not that small to start hating her for that, I let it slide anyways, though it bugged the hell out of me. So as you all know how important your last year of highschool is, she kind of just felt so down she lost a great deal of weight but it's kinda weird how I started to careless about details, about her too, of course, guessing because I was let down so many times. But anyways, my feelings for her started to fade, but regardless, I still tried to cheer her up, pushing her to study but she gave me the cold shoulders and even got mad at me for ""interfering"" with her life. And ever since we talked less. Then lately I don't know what is wrong with me but I just started feeling hatred for her. I didn't even blame myself for that. I just...Hated her. But for some reasons, I can't quite tell her and I don't even know why, why our distance grew and why I loved her and now I hate her.

225,"A friend of mine is being mean, or am I sensitive?
A long time friend of mine (let’s call her Abby) has recently been a little cruel imo, but I’m not sure if it’s me. These three things happen in less than 2 days and now we’re not speaking. Also, we’re 14 and just started high school.

1: She laughed at my new haircut. I know that sounds frivolous, but Abby and this other girl were literally outright laughing. She claims she was just ‘being honest’.

2: She left me wandering. We had agreed to walk to an after school event together. She started walking without me and didn’t tell me, so I was walking around the high school, sending her a million messages trying to find her. I guessed she had left, but I didn’t want to ditch her if she hadn’t. I eventually just walked by myself. When I got there (late) it turned out she walked with two other girls (including the hair-laughing girl). When I called her out she said I was overreacting and that walking alone shouldn’t bother me (it didn’t, I was upset because she didn’t care about me) and that she wouldn’t care if the shoe was on the other foot. All I asked was that she apologize and next time *let me know* if she changed plans, which earned a sarcastic/sassy ‘we’ll sor-ry’.

3: Another friend of mine and Abby’s (it’s a trio friendship) asked to hang out (her name will be Robin). Abby didn’t come which I was kind of glad about, so it was just me and Robin. We walked around town and all. It wasn’t even very late (6:00) when this one group of guys (4 of them, 18ish) hollered at us from their car. At first we thought it was a prank, but it kept going. They did this multiple times, following us or looping back around to greet us. We were getting freaked out. So, when they loop back around again I’ve had enough. I yelled at them to F*** off.

I thought this was smart. I figured they’d either realize we weren’t having fun or something. Surprise, surprise, it made things worse. A lot worse.

Eventually, they got stuck at a light and we sprinted to a family members house nearby (who turned out had recently been hospitalized) and hid there until my Mom came.

Now, I know the F off move was incredibly dumb. I made it worse not only for myself but for my friend. Either way, the next day I was feeling guilty as hell and worried about Robin and what she thought of me and was just stressed in general. Not in a good mood.

I don’t even tell my friend what happened, she greets me with weird hints about last night. So I simply ask her to stop with these weird hints and actually talk to me. Basically, Robin told her about last night. So Abby being super nice says, to the best of my memory, “You realize your mistake, right? You understand that it was your fault. So just so you know, I have no sympathy at all.”

I know I was dumb, but hearing this after everything and what I already blamed myself for being told so bluntly and harshly at me by my friend set me off. I left and actually went and cried in the girls washroom that I know no one ever uses. I’m not sure what I expected, it was my fault, but she *greeted* me like this. No, “Hey, I heard you were followed...” or ANYTHING. Just straight up “it’s your fault I have no sympathy.” Like, Hey, nice to see you too.

Either way, we’re not talking anymore. I’ve tried to bring it up but it’s always, “I was just being honest... what did you expect? So you want me to lie? You’re being silly...” No acknowledgement. Also, this fight between me and Abby is affecting my friendship with Robin because it was a trio friendship. Also, Abby is my only friend at my school, I’m scared to be alone.

Sorry for how long this is, I think it’s sort of a rant too. What should I do? Am I completely out of line? How should I go about fixing this?

At the very least, how can I prevent this from affecting me and Robin?

226,"My bestfriend ruined my life.
So, I am a 21 year old girl. I go to college, it's my third year and it all started two, almost three years.
This girl, my ""best friend"" told me that her old friends from primary school came to see her and she invited me. I rejected it. I am very shy and anxious around people and she knew it. They were both boys, one of them being her old love interest and one of them... well. My future love interest, the man I thought my future. I've never been in a relationship, like I've said my depression and anxiety made me believe that I am not worth it and nobody is going to love me. So she asked that he wants to meet with me and how he can do that etc. I wanted to give my number to him, I told her that I would love to talk with him because she told me a lot about him. A basketball player -my favorite sports-, goes to San Francisco State University, loves motorcycles -like me- and wears all black -like me- and has blue eyes, dark hair etc. She told me that he doesn't use any social media, even his phone because he hated them as a kid too. I was like okay it's a oersonal preference. Like, at this point I wasn't serious. Because I didn't think he would like me. So I said let's try to talk with him because someone like him wouldn't like me anyway. 

On my 19th birthday I got an e-mail. 
It was from him. 

He was telling me happy birthday, how he wanted to write me and meet me. I was stupid, I flew with his message and we started talking. It was so beautiful. He was so sweet and kind. He was everything I wanted. Times go by, we decide to try ""us"" in a relationship. Mind you, until then I haven't seen him once, even though I asked to see his face. Not because I only care about physical stuff, because it was too good to be true. My mind, my mind wasn't accepting the fact that someone like him would like me. 

We started dating, talking each other 24/7 but without any Skype or calling. I haven't heard his voice once. One year passed, I totally fell in love, he told me he was in love and because of his family problems he couldn't open himself. 

Few things ruined me after our magical but almost ""it's nothing but a dream"" year. 
First he lied to me about visiting me 3 times. He told me that he gor the ticket and he was on the way to the airport. He never came. 
Second time I cried my heart out because of an accident. We were talking with my ""bestie"" the girl who met us, and she send me a conversation quotes. Her argument with one of her friends. When he sent an e-mail... The exact conversation she sent me was on the bottom of his mail. We used to send tons of hearts with each mail, I guess she forgot copying the hearts again. And sent me the conversation. 
Third time he decided to talk on Kik. You know after almost 1.5 years I wanted to speak normally, not with e-mails. I was so happy, I forgot everything he did to me, especially the mental abuse and fights about my male friends,  I said yes  open yourself to me, let me be with you etc. I was happy. A message came to me from an account with his initials. However without me having a chance to look at the message a notification about my bestie appeared on my phone, let's name her ""Aurora"" about opening a Kik account with his initials. I asked her what the fuck was going on and she told me it was a joke. 
He never send a message from Kik. 

Over time, my mental position got worse and worse. I'd hurt myself regularly, I'd cry at nights and I'd walk around without any emotions. 
Our friendship whit my ""bestie"" did end before me and he ended. When she got a new phone, her e-mail app gave an error. Until she fixed it he didn't mail me even once. Fourteen days. When her phone got fixed, he started writing me immediately. 

I knew it was her. I knew it was her from the beginning but I was too hopeful to believe that someone would love me. Now I'm here, with tons ıf new friends, friends I've made after her i, because her rude actions and poisonous words left us alone in the class. However I cannot deal with it. I still hope that he was real. I cannot stand the idea about a HUMAN BEING can do such a thing to a person she called as friend. I cannot deal with it. I would love to have some advice. It's been 2 weeks since my second semester has started but I cannot go to school because she will be there. And I am afraid I may hurt myself or worse, I may hurt her at some point. ",ND
227,"As I sit here waiting for my friends to come over, I’ve come to realize how important friendship is. Friends can take the place of family and at the end of the day our true friends are always by our side win or lose! Isn’t it funny someone not related to you can be so important. I’m grateful.

228,"hot and cold friend
I do quite a bit of online gaming on console the past year and have made some great friendships during the span of time. Some of them have developed into stronger friendships (we bond on more than just gaming). I became close with one guy in particular and I'd say he's become one of my best friends. We met each other through a mutual group but through shared interests and our ease in conversation, we became close enough to add each other on various social platforms and IM. Initially, we texted all the time but I've been noticing very recently, his texts have gotten shorter and less frequent. I get that eventually friendships can go through lulls but I feel like things have changed. I had always thought he was very sweet and affectionate; always asking about my day, initiating conversations, and just being a kind friend in general. If it's been a couple of hours and i haven't replied, he'd message me to check up. I admit it was a bit intense at first but I had gotten used to it and reciprocated. But now that he's kind of dropped off, I feel like I am becoming overbearing and that's the last thing I want to be. I feel like I'm putting in more effort to keep a conversation going these days. I've brought up the change in our interaction but he reassures me nothing is wrong yet things just aren't what they used to be. On top of that, I am starting to feel this tiny annoyance grow inside of me...I don't nearly game as much as he does so when I do come online, we usually play games together. Sometimes we play with other friends but about half the time or more, we game with each other. We don't really play in groups much because he's a bit of an introvert and doesn't feel comfortable in large group settings. The other day, I was invited to play with a friend we made online. Prior to this, my friend and I had some particularly frustrating games so he was signing off early. But me not wanting to play with our new friend alone, i told him i got an invite and got him back online pretty quick to join me...but the whole time he was kind of silently sulking until he texted me he just thought it was weird that this guy would want to play with me and that was what made him feel weird. Eventually he warmed up and started talking like a normal person so I was happy by the time I called it a night and found that all of them were bonding. These incidents have happened a handful of times in the past month and it's left me slightly annoyed and very confused.

229,"Fucked up Families- Mamas From Hell
We all got that fucked up incident in our families, right? Well, Imma vent about mine, cause it real fucked. For me at least, right, so am a naive virgin eighteen year old, wanna yknow experience sex and dig a guy and stuff, so I go on the dating apps and meet a lad, real nice too, sweet and that, I obviously am attracted to him. So we date and do all the couple stuff like movies and sex and I am on cloud nine cause he an older man so like am cool at school (super super shallow and lame but yknow, naive virgin eighteen year old trying to live up to social pressures exerted by my peers). Anyway, I like the dude, and we fall for each other, we married now with kids so we chill. Right, so a month or two in, he gets all funny on a night out and makes us go somewhere quiet away from our mates, which I dont catch onto cos yknow am like shitfaced and cant feel my face so I dont realise nothing is up at all. Right so he says to me, I shagged a girl before you and am like dude thats not a surprise yknow you told me you had women before me. That shit fair enough cause hes older and yknow its normal for partners to experiment before settling for one. And he goes well I like you, a lot, and I dont want this girl to ruin shit and am like, well I dont see how you arent still shagging her are you? he isnt still shagging her right, so yknow good boy, however, he shagged her before me, like six months before me and yknow what can happen in six months? A goddamn baby can grow in the mofo womb during that time. Hes pissed, he was like I told her it was a shag, she agreed, told me she was on the pill and it mustve glitched that month (as the story always goes) and she got preggaz. I told her to terminate (dude this is a condensed version of the story, there was emotion and shit behind it, so dont go all prolife on me, it's just a minor detail im trying get out there and passed so I can tell the rest of the story). Right, so she starts kicking off saying hes emotionally black mailing her into an abortion and talking about a baby she lost as a teen and shit and am like, okay so just back off. He did, and she came back a few months later like lol theres another guy, not sure if hes the dad or not, I think its you tho. Like, good, thanks bitch, a think its you is all the proof I need. So she sends him laods of scans and basically pretends hes her baby daddy. Annoyed me a bit cos yknow i was a teen wanting to mess round and just yknow settle with this guy and this chick is trying to like worm her way in. She makes friends with his sister on fb (weird cos he doesnt have contact with any of his family, hasnt for like four years prior that) and starts getting pally with his mum dad brothers, all of them. Tells them I was his mistress and they were a couple, they decided to have a baby, and when she got pregnant he started messing round with me, a teenage girl. Fews holes in that story but well skip ahead, and the baby is born. They get this dodgy dna that says its not admissable in court due to infrequencies or something and that close relatives (she was shagging his brother at the time too) could skewer results. Basically the baby daddy could be his bro but itll come back his cause its a shit dna. Anyway it came back the baby was his and he suddenly goes all fatherly. Doesnt see the kid for like six months then starts visits and pays maintance. Meanwhile, shes fucking round going to his family and bitching about how horrible I am being a homewrecker and all that eventho they were a shag and got with him six months after her. He wont get another dna cause he was like paid for one not doing another, and I explained the issues but he wont. ALl our children look identical, the kid has blond hair and blue eyes, me and my partner are both dark and so are our kids, (the girl in question also is dark so where the fuck blond blue eyes came from is beyond me). For months after she kept ringing me saying omg you need to put him on the phone the babys sick and he needs to visit, and if you ignore it shed up it and be like an ambulance is coming now omg its serious (it never was). The kid was in hospital like twenty times in his first week of life, each time let out with nothing serious wrong, altho she exaggurated and made out he was on the brink of death. Tries to get him to take her kids out while Im in mofo labour, giving birth and shes kicking off on the phone saying hes not spending enough time with them. Once I gave birth comes round screaming and shouting how hes off the birth certificate, how shes changing the kids name and how shes taking him to court for more money yhadda yhadda yhadda. Mama from Hell, legit worst parent and just a nightmare to deal with, the shit that baby been through already, feel sorry for it.

I'm 20 years old and I've been with my boyfriend a little over 2 years. I know I'm young. Will my relationship last forever? There's a good chance it won't because both of us are very young. However, that doesn't mean I don't know how to be in a relationship or know if I love someone or not.

My mom has a bad habit of asking really odd, seemingly disrespectful questions to me and my brother about our relationships. A popular one she gives me is ""I don't think you love him, he's more like you friend."" She asked me this tonight over a phone call and I got upset with her and expressed how I feel uncomfortable and disrespected when she tells me things like that. Like she know's everything about my relationship, somehow, when I hardly tell her anything about it because her and my dad are quite old fashioned and very religious. She's told me things like this many times before, and usually I try to just try to brush it off, but I'm trying to get her to understand and communicate better with me and my brother.  She went on to say say ""but i'm your mom, I can ask things like that."" I understand she has a much different point of view, especially because she's older, but I just personally feel it's disrespectful to say that I don't love my boyfriend and that ""he's just a friend."" She kind of rolled her eyes at me, flatly said goodnight, and hung up.

Am I overreacting? i feel like I shouldn't be guilty for expressing my feelings of being uncomfortable with the questions she asks me. My parents have both lacked communication skills my whole life, and it's put us in a rocky relationship. I love my mom, but I'm just trying to get her to understand modern day relationships and me as pretty much a grown adult. Thoughts?",ND

232,"Abusive dad or I'm just toxic...
Two weeks ago, my dad lost our dog. It went to the shelter but due to the microchip ownership issue, we have to wait two weeks to get her. I told my family that there's a chance that we might not get the dog back. 


My dad then started saying how it's fate that the dog is gone and that if we can't get it back then it's destiny. I got annoyed and said ""But really, it's because you weren't being careful and you left her at the park"". He then started yelling at me. Saying he's the only one who walks the dog. I then said I walk the dogs as well, I just don't do it enough because I'm the only one in the family who works from morning to night, paying for the bills, groceries and everything. 


He then claimed that it's not his fault and then started saying how if someone told him to look after their child and he accidently killed it, would it be his fault. I responded with yes, it is your fault because it's under your duty of care. Anyway, things got ugly from there.



I didn't speak to him for a week. He got my sister to ask me to pay for his bills and fines. I paid for the $500 one today this morning. Then he asked to borrow my car, and I lent it to him. After that, he came back and started throwing passive jabs at me by talking to the dog. 

e.g. ""Bailey, you're lucky that I'm here. If i wasn't here, you would've died a long time ago. Some people just know how to talk and don't do shit."" 

I got annoyed and said you lost the dog. Get over it. He then yelled at me. I got annoyed and told him to fuck off. He then started saying ""wow, you're being so disrespectful. God will punish you. I wish you die and I wish you'll live out your life alone."" 

I then said ""You came home and started a fight for no reason. Don't play the victim when I argue back"". 

He then said ""I'm just talking to myself. You don't have to listen to me.""

I then said ""Go talk to the wall then."" I shut the door and continue with my business.

He then walked next to my door and started going on and on about how I'll die soon for being disrespectful and that god will send a lightning bolt to hit me. I then angrily snapped at him saying ""I may or may not die before you, but I can bet that if you die, no one in this fucking world would mourn for you"".

I then shut the door, and I didn't hear anything from him again.

233,"Why is it so difficult to preserve wealth within a family for longer than one hundred years?
Some family members can make fortune during their lifetime. Because they were lucky, or because they worked hard, or smart. It doesn’t matter. It is almost inevitable that after two generations passing the lucky one the third generation returns to the poverty with very poor financial background.
There are always and always will be more failures than successful stories.

Why is it happening?

Because of mismanagement.
There are no other reasons!
Not because they are too old, too young, too tall, or too stupid…
But, because they failed to create a system which can monitor, rule, manage, predict future successes and failures.
Most families have no idea that such systems have been existing and successfully helping some families to do this job efficiently.

Do those families share this knowledge with humanity?
No way. Why would they do that? They literally rule the world, they have all the power and all the money.
I’m fortunate to collaborate with some of those families.
What if I ask you:
Would it be interesting for you to uncover their secrets and to know how they do it?
Would it be interesting for you to see a blueprint of their success?

Many families are struggling in our society.

They have no idea where they are going to and what goals they have. 
It leads to frustration, procrastination, apathy and depression. 
Because they have been caught in a daily routine. Day after day, month after month…
No time to think, no time to plan, no time to review or set goals.
In my opinion, this is the reality for 99,99% of the human population of the Earth.
Is there a solution?

Yes!

But, you have to implement some strategies.
It includes not only intellectual, emotional and spiritual development, but financial evolution also.
Without a strong financial fundament, it is almost impossible to cultivate wealth in your family in a long-term run.

234,"Should I still communicate with my father?
Hello everyone. So the past few days my mom caught my dad cheating on her (2 women specifically). Now my mom sent him a closure to cut the ties (we live on the US while my dad is on another country). I'm angry and familiar with this feeling as well because my previous girlfriend cheated on me too (I guess it runs on the blood to be cheated on).

Right now I don't know if I should cut my ties as well, as I can't forgive someone who broke my mom's heart and also someone who can't be contented at all. I'm 24 and take full responsibility on her.

236,"Help - unplanned pregnancy at 41, wife wants to keep it
Hello, I need some real advice.

My wife and I were married in 2011. We dated four years and the day we married was the best day of my life. We immediately became pregnant with our daughter, who is now 5. A couple of years later we welcomed our son (now almost 3).  

Brief introduction of us - I'm almost 41 and she almost 37. I work full time and she recently became a stay at home mom.  We are middle class, homeowners living in Seattle, college degrees, financially responsible, socially liberal on most issues, have good friend circle (many with similar aged children), good family support live in area. Both of us raised in healthy and happy traditional nuclear homes. Our traditional marriage is good and based on trust, but I won't lie and say the last 5 years of raising two children hasn't been without its challenges and occasional spat. But we married for life, and at the altar when I said I do forever, I meant it. Overall, we are fortunate and thankful for our lives.

After the birth of our second child, I was done.  I had considered getting a vasectomy (snipped). Many of my dad friends had done it and recommended I do it. My wife was against it, and I wasn't really wanting to do it either for other reasons.

My wife always semi-joked she wanted another kid, and had quipped she felt incomplete and that being a mother is her calling.  She is an excellent, patient mother to our children.  However, I felt it was a phase and she could get her ""baby fix"" with friends newborns.  I did not feel a need to have another child, and was quite against it. I was frank with her on the matter, but because of the differing opinion and emotional confrontation, we avoided discussing it at length.

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago when my wife informs me she missed her period and sure she is pregnant. No visits to the doctor yet to confirm, but we have never had problems conceiving, and I believe she is pregnant.  Our birth control was her counting her monthly cycle, which she is pretty good at.  I always reached for a condom just in case, but she does not like using them and told me it was not needed. Well we slipped one past the goalie.  

When she told me, I reacted poorly, saying it would mess up the good thing we had going, I was tired and didn't have the energy, our family was complete already.  Not to mention the fact that it was be financially very difficult (we'd have to buy a larger house and I don't need to tell you what Seattle real estate is like). We are quite squeezed in our little home already. I told her she would have to go back to work. I asked her to terminate the pregnancy. To sum it up, it wasn't the reaction she was hoping to hear.

The next week I bounced between many emotions. Anger, for upsetting our lives, even considering the idea she intentionally got pregnant. Fear, that our stable little family might crumble, that 3 makes an odd man out and the children would suffer. Fear, that she isn't healthy for this, as she is showing some physical ailments/breakdown that shouldn't be ignored and having another child will only fixing those off further. Fear, that I'm suffering physical ailments as well and don't have the energy to go through another round of caring for an infant. Fear, that both her parents and mine are elderly and close to needing care from us, and that they won't be there to be the ""relief valve"" and help with watching the kids when we need it. Anxiousness, that we had just got out of having the kids in diapers and were just starting the ""next phase"" of our children being autonomous and doing activities I could participate in. Guilt, for crushing her dreams and not supporting the idea of a third child when its something she wants very badly. 

One day I wrote out an objective list of reasons (many of which are cited above) why having a third child was a bad idea. After a few more days of trying to ignore the issue, we had our blowup.  I presented her my list and she listened, acknowledging they were valid and made sense. She then countered with her belief that this was meant to be, and she could not in good conscious have an abortion. It would stay with her forever and she says she would never get over it, and would forever resent me for pushing the issue.  I told her I might resent the child and her for letting this happen.   I slept on the couch that night, feeling disgust and bitterness.

The next morning there was nothing else to do but discuss it more. I again said I wasn't interested, and she can't force this on me. She again countered with her same argument that it was meant to be, that our ""next phase"" of children would just have to wait a few more years.  I yelled I would be almost 60 years old at this child's high school graduation. I want to play sports with my kids and be active, not the ""old dad"". I said I wouldn't care, not even over the name we would give it. I said I wound't go with her to the doctor appointment.  I told her she was being selfish and not putting what she has now over what she might have. She told me she would start contacting a divorce lawyer if this was how it was going to be.

It's only been a few days since that talk, but I am completely stunned and not myself.  I was a zombie at work, not able to focus on anything. At home I've been short tempered and avoiding everything.  I've cried in my car, cried in the bathroom. Borderline panic attacks.  I'm frantically researching mental health professionals, as I need to talk to someone. I haven't seen a counselor since before we were married.  I can't talk to my family or friends until the doctor visit to confirm the pregnancy.  I feel like an absolute asshole for saying the things I said and my attitude, and I can't take that back. Even if it isn't a viable pregnancy, or she miscarries, I've made my mark and she will always think less of me. I'm scared she regrets even having ever met me.  I absolutely DO NOT want to break up our family, I love my children and family. I am certain a divorce would ruin all of us.  

We are at an absolute impasse. She is set in her mind, the only thing that could stop this is the doctor saying she or the baby are not healthy and viable. 

I'm beside myself. It's not that I don't love children, I really do. And I know I'll still love the child regardless, it's not the child's fault and they should not be treated unfairly. And she may be right, that it is only raising another baby is temporary and it'll pass and everything will be OK and we will all be happier. But what if it's not? What if this was a bad idea and our quality of life is destroyed? What if I do resent her, or she resents me because of my opinion. What if her feeling of being ""incomplete"" is just a phase and she really just misses doting on a newborn. What if that feeling doesn't go away after a third child? Am I the selfish one? Are my doubts unreasonable?  What can I do?

237,"Is My Friend A Bad Friend?
I have a friend. When I moved to a foreign country, I went to a school and met this friend. We have been quite close but after I moved back to my country, we’ve only been communicating through texts. She has been a helpful friend but I don’t know if she is a good friend or a bad friend. 

There were many occasions when I wondered if I should break friends with her, but I always told myself that she didn’t mean to ever hurt me and I kept on trying my best to act like nothing was wrong and acted friendly. But I srsly can’t hold it in and I wanna know if I’m just being sensitive.. 

These are some of the things she does that makes me wonder if we should break friends..

1.We use eachother’s selfies as our profile pics and I always use the best selfies of hers or at least what I think are the best looking ones. And I sent her a video if me singing with my other friend and she took a screenshot in the middle of the video and used it as her profile pic and My mouth was wide open and my eyes were scrunched up and it really looked horrible and when I asked her to change it, she asked what I meant and that it didnt look bad. 

Sure she couldve been being nice and I could’ve been acting emotional but I really didn’t like other people who I didn’t even know seeing a photo like this so I pleaded her to change it but I tried to keep the joking and friendly mood. However then she said “Funny. U wouldn’t wanna see the other screenshot I took.” And we both didn’t say anything. And she didn’t change it. 

2.The way she texts me depends on her mood. If she isn’t feeling friendly, she barely answers my texts and replies with short answers and doesn’t laugh at anything funny I have to say.

 I wondered if I could also be acting like that at times but I looked back at our conversations and ai never let my mood change the way I replied to her, and I honestly didn’t even speak in an unfriendly way when she said something rude to me or something that made me feel offended.

3.She doesn’t act like she cares for what I have to say. Whenever something bad happens to me and I tell her, she just gives a small reaction and talks about something else.

4.She ignores my texts. There was once a time when she saw my texts and didnt reply. I asked why she didn’t reply and she saw it but ignored it. I thought that maybe she had something important going on so I just kept on texting her every few hours like nothing was wrong cuz I don’t exactly like showing others when I feel hurt. 

She read my texts and ignored me for two whole days and finally texted me back as if nothing had happened. She didn’t apologize for not replying nor did she give an explanation. She just texted me about something else she wanted to say. There were lots of cases like this.

5.She acts like she has the worst life. I go through alot of stress each day cuz I have had family troubles and sometimes had been bullied. I have also often had suicidal thoughts. 

However whenever I tell her about things that are stressing me out, she points out that her life is worse. I understand that she has her own troubles but I really dont like the way she underestimates my life and doesn’t care for it.

6.She once cyber bullied me. When I left her school and left the country, we had a small fight and she told her friends about the bad things I had once said, not mentioning her faults. She then invited me to a group chat with lots of people and they all fought against me, calling me fat,ugly,short,stupid,and dumb. They also made racial comments and insulted my mom. 

After a year passed, I texted her. I can’t believe I did it, but I said that I WAS SORRY. And she said that she forgave me and now we’re talking like friends again. 

But whenever I bring up a little detail from the past, she gets mad and says that I am blaming her for the past and makes me feel guilty for something I shouldn’t be guilty about.

7.She thinks that she is perfectly innocent. I’m not saying shes a totally horrible person, she can be a good friend at times, but I gotta admit that at times she can be horrid.. 
And whenever something bad happens to her, she says that she doesn’t get what she did to deserve it and that she is getting mistreated. 

If you think about it that way, I feel like I also deserve this, considering Im not a saint or an angel. But whenever my friend says that she didnt do anything bad to deserve some bad things that happened to her, I can’t help but feel disappointed at the fact that she doesn’t realize  how much she hurted me

238,"Should i bother what best friend think about me?
I feel like garbage, i have no friends. When im with others, i try to be interesting, and funny, never harm others or depress others with sad stuffs. I think with friends you can loose up and be yourself. But my BEST friend have something problem with me. I think he dont like who i am, how i behave.

Sometimes he notices something about me. What i should have said, or done...like a mother see how her children behave. There was time when he bashed me because i was silent, or because i asked a question about our mutual FRIEND. This weekend we would held a little surprise party to our friend but he said to me, behave and be nice. If i was wrong or bad.

Nobody ever told me if i said, done something wrong. Never. He every time say something. He is very sumbissive to others, always go after others. And if he dont like someone, he always talks behind his/her back to me. He has friends i dont. And i feel a sack of ... because of this. I starting to have enough about how he wants me to behave within FRIENDS and pushing this ""you are bad"" feeling to me. I think this is not friendship, he is not my friend. If you are friend with someone, you like him/her who the person is. If i cant be myself within friends, i cant be myself elsewhere.

Stepped back from this party, and said im sick. This weekend felt bad because of him. What should i do?

240,"Tipped off by someone that best friend is not okay
It's been a semester in college and people here are very interesting. 
Recently, I [F] made a best friend Theo* [M] in class. We're both in the same major, speak the same native language, and he always helps me understand the homework (he's smarter than me), meaning that we spend about 2 hours/day together, if not more. We got super close within a few weeks, and I started to develop a crush on him. But I have a boyfriend (long-distance), and my feelings for Theo were not sexual, so I resolved to think of Theo as just an older brother - it hasn't been a problem for a few weeks now. We still hang out as best friends.

My primary means of communication with him is facebook in our native language. A week before, he added me on snapchat, but we never talk on it. The other day, I got a snap with a mispelling of my name, to which I sent a question mark. The day after, I got a snap from a girl Lucy* claiming to be Theo's boyfriend, who told me she got my username from Theo. She told me that he was acting weird, and for my name w/mispelling, to look out for him since they were also long distance. 

I don't know how to approach the situation. I want to make sure that Theo is okay, since I did have some problems with suicidal/bored/lonely friends before. But he never told me that he has a girlfriend or about Lucy, and when I took to other forms of social media to find her, I couldn't find her - she wasn't in any tagged photos of Theo either. I may be completely over thinking, but I also think that Lucy has ascess to Theo's snap, which is how she got to me - meaning that I'm not sure if Theo knows that I know Lucy. If she has ascess to the snap, she could also have acess to his facebook (although I'm pretty sure she can't speak our native language).... Basically, I'm not sure how to approach him to ask if he's okay okay. I always ask how his day was, and it ranges from okay to sleepy. So if I ask if he's okay, he might ask me why I thought he wasn't okay, and I don't think I can say his girlfriend was wondering - we don't talk about relationship stuff, I don't think he know I have a boyfriend, although this is posted all over my social media.

When we were texting he would respond with one word answers and never wanted to talk about anything. He didnt have any favorite tv shows and he didnt listen to music.

244,"Shoudl I just stop being friends with this guy?
I made a post on this subreddit a couple days ago. I thought that all my friends disliked me because I am mean to them, but for a solid 2-3 days I was the nicest I had been to anyone for what I remember, I asked all my friends how their days were, bought them food, listened to them. And it worked, they all are my very good friends now, but there is just one problem, the person who I considered my BEST friend is being a dick. Once I get attached to someone it’s hard for me to let go. For example, in my previous relationship, I hated my gf, and I hated being with her, talking to her, I found her annoying, I never broke up with her, then, one day she decidedI was neglecting her so she said she wanted to break up, I begged her to stay even though I hated everything about her. We still end up breaking up, afterwards I was soo happy. Now, this person who I considered to be my BEST friend makes fun of me all the time for getting dumped by a girl and saying “you got left by an ugly girl for a gay guy.” This sentence aline can tell you about his personality and how bad of a person he is. Today, my scho went to a ski park, I enjoyed my day, had fun, everythkng was fine. On the bus ride back to school, I was talking to my so called “best friend.” He randomly went up to a girl I didn’t know and told her I liked her, she then said “I don’t care.” I don’t know if this was a rejection or just a simple “I don’t care” but I didn’t really care because I didn’t find her attractive at all. I laugh it off and end up saying the word “nigga.” Now, I am what you would call a mulatto. I am bi-racial, half black, half white. After I said this word, a girl sitting behind me called me a racist. I then say that i’m half black and she says “I know.” This was embarrassing, I get made fun of a lot because of the tone of my skin and my ethnicity, it’s one if the things that still get to me. Moving on, he proceeds to point at me and laugh, then, scream at me saying I got rejected by the girl I didn’t even like or ask out. I stood up on the bus and accidentally touched a girl’s tit, she got very mad and I apologized but you could tell she was still mad. We get to school and he starts pushing me into doors and lockers, he is much bigger than me and I couldn’t really push him back easily. The day ends then we take the bus back home, me and this kid are on the same bus and he says, “you’re gross, nobody likes you and you got rejected by the ugliest girl in school. That’s why you got dumped by an ugly bitch.” And he walked away, as i’m walking home, I was talking to some friends and they treat me like a fucking human, they were nice, didn’t insult me, and treated me nicely. I got home and here I an, what should I do, he has managed to get the whole school to believe I am a perv, racist, ugly, nobody. It’s actually funny, he was the first person to ever talk to me, he was nice to me but after a while it just turned out he was a bad person, I wish one of the other guys were first to approach me, i’d have much better friends. What do I do, it’s one one of the hardest things to dispel gossip, everybody thought I was gay when I first came to the school, I got a girlfriend, suspicion gone, but how am I gunna disprove im not racist, not a perv, and how the hell am I supposed to deal with this “friend” if mine?",ND

246,"Help...Relationship with my depressed, mentally messed up friend
This is my first time posting on reddit, sorry if I have made any mistakes.

This post is gonna be quite long. To start with, my friend and I are both 15 year olds living in Hong Kong and we study in the same school. She is a great person, very special, someone I can never forget. The problem is that she is the kind of person who smiles in front of people but is actually depressed. And I feel like I will just make things worse.

Because of her laughs and near-crazy actions, nobody knows her true feelings. In fact she constantly complains about everything, being unpopular, being immature, the education system here, her online friends, just to mention a few. She is tired and feels like a loser all the time. Games and cosplaying is the only way she escapes from reality. I don't mind listening to rants. It's ok to be sad. But I seriously do not know how to respond when she comes up with questions related to suicide.

During lessons my friend would show me long paragraphs about her self hate and ask for my reply. A typical example of our conversation: ""Why am I so unpopular?"" ""..."" ""WHY AM I SO UNPOPULAR."" ""...maybe you have different hobbies and interests from most people?"" Then she starts to regret her choices, why did she choose to study in this school, if she had been in another school, she would have been happier... etc.

In her letters, she questioned about the meaning of life. She wrote about ""nightmares"", ""thought crimes"" and ""leaving the endless circle of life"". That left me terrified. All I could do is to sit next to her speechless. If I said something wrong she would just jump off from the roof. Not to mention all those confusing philosophical questions. I can never give an answer simply because I don't know how.
I once asked the school social workers how to talk to a depressed friend. Her advice was literally trash, and I ended up crying when I talked about her suicidal thoughts. I have no idea what to do. The next day when you see her at the school gates, she puts on that smile again, but she definitely has problems.

So my sister and I are both adults. I'm 29 and she is 26. Neither of us live at home anymore. I have my ~~only~~ own little nuclear family now and she is renovating a house with her long time boyfriend. Since we have been adults we have noticed that our parents marriage isn't exactly happy. Our parents are basically polar opposites. Dad is a really outgoing people person who likes to have lots of activities and friends. However, he is very very emotional and can blow up at the slightest hint of ""disrespect."" If something is wrong it is never his fault, you know the type. Mom is quiet and reserved, not much on physical or verbal affection at all. Her only hobby/activity is through music ministry at our church. My dad joined the church when they got married, but he isn't religious really and only comes on the holidays. Lately my sister has been really distressed by our parents relationship. She is very empathetic and it really upsets her when they fight. So much so, that she does not want to be around them anymore because of it. Today she told me that she thinks we should have some sort of intervention with them about their marriage. My sister and I have discussed before that they probably should really be divorced, but that it will never happen because our mom is Catholic. I think an ""intervention"" would just make it worse because I know my dad will see it as a personal attack.

249,"Is she toxic or am I reading too much into it...rant warning
So to nutshell my relationship with her is that we met at our last job and hang out a lot. It's still a fairly new friendship but I'm noticing some things that are starting to get to me. I'm unemployed now and she has a awesome new job.

So first thing I noticed was she didn't used to be the one to call me   but then when she needs a ride somewhere then she wants to chat and will try to segway the ride request in. If she made a habit out of calling any other time then I wouldn't stress it. It just makes me feel used when ""I just want to check on you"" turns to ""I need a ride"". 

Which brings me to the other issue. When she does call me it's the most disrespectful phone etiquette I have ever seen. After she knows she is going to get a ride she stays on the call(must be out of guilt or not wanting to make it seem like it's the only thing she wants.) but while she's on the phone she does not pay attention to me. Like she'll make active listening sounds that don't match up, like uh huh and a giggle when I just told her that I might need to give my cats up. Without telling me or warning or any sort of hint she'll just start talking to someone else around her like I'm not even on the other end. Worst yet almost always these calls are while she is at work and is just bored. On my end I'm distraction free and at the most filling out a job applications or pacing and I dunno I feel like if you are going to call your friend you should acknowledge they are on the other line and not just background noise while you browse the internet. 

Which brings me to her job. Her job to me is the most ideal job I could think of and I already know that but she brags about to the point that I'm getting really bitter. She keeps telling me about how many hours she's getting and during one of those phone calls even worked out how much she was expecting to make on her next check(unprompted). And she's so excited about 3 week paid vacation she is getting, and her health benefits and tuition reimbursement so she's going to take some classes on company dime. I mean I expressed how happy I was for her but she brings it up enough that I just wonder if she likes hurting me. 

Then there is her and her boyfriend. There is a whole thing about her and her psycho ex who even though made her feel afraid for her life, she still loves and talks to. WHILE WITH HER BOYFRIEND. I don't think she cheats on her boyfriend but I don't understand that whole deal that seems like an issue for another reddit thread all together. But yeh she does brag about how much sex she has with her boyfriend and how much they love each other. Which brings me to this next issue that I couldn't even wrap my head around.

So I brought her home from work the other night and we were hanging out at my apartment. At some point she realizes that she forgot her keys back at work. This was after her work closed for the day. So I don't see the big deal I offer up ""well when your boyfriend picks you up then he can let you in."" But she doesn't seem to be hooking to that and is like ""I'm going to check the bus scheduled and just because I'm curious I'll check uber prices."" I'm really confused at this point. 

Essentially, her plan was to just go to her boyfriends work and hang out there till he finishes closing. Keep in mind we are neighbors, he doesn't have to go out of his way more than one street over and he has picked her up from my place before. Now he works about 30mins away so it would be a hell of a trek to drop her off there and make way back while it's dark and rainy and I don't know the area at all. At some point the brother of her boyfriend calls and says they can go hangout while she's locked out and she doesn't even ask me if I want to join or anything just leaves as if she had just been waiting at the busstop that whole time. 

She reassures me that she does like hanging out and I think we do have fun when she is hanging out. So I really don't want to cut her out of my life as I tend to do. It's just tonight seemed to be the worst.

So she calls me up and tells me that her boyfriend is off of work so she won't need a ride and she thought that we could all hangout. Since we were going to meet up with some more friends.

Welp, the other friends canceled and it was just us 3. We had some dinner and then her boyfriend suggested we go see a movie. I was already dressed and ready so why the hell not. I'm pretty sure she agreed(it's honestly hard to tell sometimes with her.) We got there and the movie me and her boyfriend were wanting to see was already playing. And she was being indecisive but eventually agreed to go. So me and him are hurrying to get to our seats while she just takes her time shuffling along. We already missed the first 15minutes. We had just had dinner but she wanted to stop at the concession and she just didn't seem interested at all about being there.

So we watch the movie and about midway she leaves, I assume to go to the bathroom but shes gone for about 15minutes and I'm just sitting there thinking ""she wants us or one of us to go check on her"" but I wanted to watch the movie and I didn't feel like putting up with her drama. 

Afterwards she passive aggressively sits at her seat through the entire credits. Which didn't have mid credit or end credit footage. So I ask her whats wrong, and she's like I just felt a wave of depression and just wanted to go home and didn't know why I was even here or watching this movie and I felt forced into the whole thing. WHICH CAME OUT OF NOWHERE. If any one was forced it was me, she called me for that night out and I feel she is trying to make herself out to be a victim in it. 

I don't want to end this with her, because I like her and her friends which I only know through her so it would mean cutting all of them out. It's just I keep seeing how selfish she can be. I don't know if this friendship can be saved or worth saving. ",ND
250,"Mom treats me like a stray cat and siblings like gold
My younger brother and sister are 10/11 years younger than I am. We have an older brother but he no longer speaks to our mother and has t for about 5 years. I’m an adult now and I fully support myself and have since I was 18. As soon as I graduated high school and child support stopped, I was tossed out of my moms with nothing but garbage bags filled with my clothes. I was told I had to live with father even tho my mother had just bought a house with her husband and my youngest siblings. My stepfather never like me and always kept me separate from their family. They would go to dinner every Friday night and I had to stay home bc he would flip out and many other mean things. To my step dad, I was a stray cat who didn’t belong near his children. My mother never stuck up for me and stayed with him until I was in my mid 20s when he cheated on her and left her. I was raised dysfunctional but bc of that I long for a close, supportive family. Once he was out of the picture, I was able to create relationships with my sister and brother. My siblings are now in their late teens and I’m 26. I’ve struggled immensely on my own I had no choice. I could have 3 dollars to my name and my mother wiuld take it from me for coffee etc. if she picked anything up for me I had to give her the money ASAP. Soon as child support stopped, legit the day I graduated i had to live with my dad and mother gave me only garbage bags with clothes.  good. Anything that had been mine was now my sisters (bedroom set, jewelry stand, American girl dolls list goes on. Now years later, my mother makes sure my brother and sister have everything and anything the very best of. Designer everything, newest clothes shoes, technology. When it comes to me, my mother doesn’t do anything at all. If she buys the coffee I am to give her to $2 but reversed she would die if I asked for the money back for he coffee. Now foremost, I’m fully aware I am an adult and can support myself. It has nothing to do with what my mother does for siblings it’s how she treats me compared to her treatment of siblings. For instance, I asked to use sisters perfumes that smelled good and was told no it’s her expensive kind. I’m not to use anything of my brother or sisters actually. My brother s d sister themselves do not care about this stuff it’s just my mom. When cleaning my face, my younger brother is allowed to use my sisters face cream or anything really bc well they are siblings. But i am not allowed to use the very same thing. If my mother is getting rid of things she will charge me full price. If she orders pizza and I eat a couple pieces I have to pay her half the money. Point I’m getting at is that she treats me like im not good enough to use my sister expensive designer perfume or face wash etc. she can buy the best of the best for them but charges me if I need anything. Holidays she spends thousands on them and if she does anything for me she only gives me gift she receives for free for spending so much as PINK etc .im not expecting to be equal. Again I’m an adult and can buy myself things but she can’t spend even $25 on a gas card or something lol I should add that it is expected of me to get her and siblings expensive gifts for their bdays and Xmas. Moms bday is in January if I happen to be broke and can only afford a $25 dunkin card, my bday in February she will get me something small or a $5 dunkin card. If I can’t afford a gift, she makes damn sure my bday co es and goes without her buying bday gift. Immature or not I’m very hurt by this. I was always a good kid, never in trouble, finished high school, went to some college and never asked for hand outs. Why am I not worth two small sprays of designer perfume?? ",ND
251,"When should you receive photos of your childhood?
Hey all,

My mother has all my childhood photos and memories locked up in her closet, along with those of my late father and his family, most of whom are long gone.

I'm 37, married, father of 2... I'm just realizing the absurdity of this.  The other day she offered to exchange one box of photos for another ""favor"" she wanted, which seemed rather hollow to me.  These are my photos, right?

The way she's currently handling it is that I'll only get these photos once she's dead... That could be up to 20 years or more, she's 76 currently.  

What makes this even more poignantly absurd is that I nearly died 2 years ago, the emergency surgery only had about 50% odds of survival.

What is she gaining by this?  Is this normal?

252,"Is this my fault?
I've been on SSI ever since high school but before high school I wasn't. My oldest aunt suggest to me to get SSI but let's call her Cancer Rat because her zodiac sign is a Cancer. I was like ""Nah, I'm good for now"" because I'm lazy I didn't feel like doing that but I didn't tell my aunt that! SO, she took it the wrong way and start yelling BLAH, BLAH THIS and BLAH, BLAH THAT. My mom was like ""Cancer Rat you cannot get mad because she decided not to do that!"" Cancer Rat gotten more mad ""I'm not mad, I was just saying."" I gotten tired of her yelling because she can't get her way. I was like ""Mom, let's just do it so Cancer Rat can shut the FUUUUUCK UP!""  

My mom was like ""Ok, let's just do it. Let's get it over with."" The thing is ever since then I was in 3rd or 4th grade the relationship between Cancer Rat and I went down hill! I stopped going to church with is where is start going down hill. She got mad because I stopped going to church with her. From time to time Cancer Rat will bring it up to manipulate me to have me feel guilty about it but I caught on to it. She makes fun of my weight, hair, clothes I wear, what I eat and drink, just everything like she's overdramatic about every fucking thing I do but I'm probably ain't the only one though. It's so bad that I can't even read a story on the Wattpad without her bitch ass accusing me of texting a boy when I wasn't! She probably hates when I play video games. In 2016 she called me mentally retarded and said I don't think straight but I don't know why and if I ask her why she said that to me that she'll just lie, lie, lie of why she said it. She gets overdramatic when she's the last to find out shit or when you stop telling her shit, stop talking to her. I stop telling shit because you'll tell her not to say anything to anyone that she'll do it anyways. She did all of this ever since I was in 3rd or 4th grade and still is til this day..  


Now you know my back story with Cancer Rat. 

Ever since 2014 I started to use Bitcoins and the only person knows I use it is my mom at the time but my brother started to find out and he ended up founding out. From 2014 to 2017 I will lose Bitcoins and wins or earn Bitcoins! Just like if I were to use the trade market, you'll win or lose some. In 2018 I wanted to make history by making thousands of dollars from a $29.00 Bitcoin investment and I did. The problem is that Cancer Rat daughter, let's call her Tuna Fish in her 30's. So I made 2 mil but the household only knew about it. Until I made a big mistake by making a youtube video about my 2 mil and shared the video to my Facebook! The mistake was sharing it to my Facebook page. Here's the thing…Tuna Fish love to lurk on people Facebook pages using her husbands account and I wasnt paying attention until after my aunt Cancer Rat confronted me about my earnings 3 days after I shared the link to my Facebook. 

Cancer Rat yell and cussed at me that accused me of using SSI money to earn my 2 mil, that I did it behind everyone's back, that I didn't even bother to let her help, that I was being greedy, I didn't even bother to tell her, that she had heard it through someone else how they showed her proof, that the person had showed her a video of it, she's disappointed in me, she will forgive but won't forget, and that she feels lefted out. Here's the thing I did use SSI to get the 2 mil because back in 2015 and 2016 that Cancer Rat b•tch ass sent a letter to them told a false story how I barely go places, that my mom have to do all the work, that I'm mentally retarded, that I rage on video games, other sh•t that I can't remember and one of the update application for SSI that Cancer Rat lied to them and said that I was in a wheel chair when I never was. 

So that's when I started to think that she might trying to get them to cut me off and thats why I used $29.00 of my SSI money to get the 2 mil as back up like I didn't think it was a big deal. It wasn't my fault to me because I wasn't the one sending letters trying to get someone cut off but my mom told me to not say anything about the letters when we had first found out and today is day to confront Cancer Rat. I had to do it. Now Cancer Rat wants to try and tell me what to do. She says ""Girl, whatever I say to you is for the best. Whatever you did to make that 2 mil that I want you to stop doing it because it's not fair that you made your first 1 mil before your 21st birthday. You didn't do anything specially to get it. I mean like you SAT ON YOUR ASS!"" She was pissed but I don't give a fuck.

I said ""I had to do what I gotta do! It's not my fault that it happen. The reason why I turn $29 to 2 mil is because some bitch trying to sabotage my SSI by sending in false letters and I wonder who? Now you're mad because I made 2 mil before my 21st birthday OMG!"" so Cancer Rat yell and cussed at me that she said ""I KNOW YOU USED YOUR FUUUUUCKING SSI MONEY TO EARN THAT 2 MIIIIIILLLLLLLLL AND YOU USED 29 FUUUUUCKING DOLLLLLLARS! YOU DID IT BEHIND EVERYONE'S BAAAAAACK! YOU DIDN'T EVEN FUUUUUCKING BOTHER TO LET ME HELP YOUUUUUUU! YOU WAS BEING GREEEEDY! YOU DIDN'T EVEN FUUUUUCKING TO TELL MEEEEEEEE! I HAD TO HEAR IT THROUGH SOMEONE ELLLLLLLSE! THEY SHOWED ME PROOOOOOF! THEY SHOULD ME A VIDEO OF IIIIIIIIIIIT! I FEEL SO FUUUUUCKING LEFT OUUUUUUUUT! I'M SO DISAPPOINTED IN YOU GIIIIIIIIIIIIRL! I'LL FORGIVE BUT I WON'T FUUUUUCKING FORGET THIS."" After Cancer Rat stopped yelling that I was about to say something but my mom beat me to the punch. 

My mom said ""Cancer Rat, how is my daughter greeeeedy when you're the only one complaining about the money like she didn't even do anything wrong at all?"" Cancer Rat got so fucking fed up that she stopped her ass out our fucking house and slam our f•cking door but while Cancer Rat and her daughter Tuna Fish was leaving that they shook their fucking heads at me!! 

Another thing before I started to use Bitcoins that this household was very poor. Trying to make ends meet. Barely trying to keep the food in the house. What made it worse when Cancer Rat and Cancer Rat daughter Tuna Fish (Cancer Rat have 2 other sons but they always in the streets doing who knows what), Cancer Rat grandkids Mices always bragging about money, money, MONEY everytime they come over to our house. ""Look we went and bought this"", ""We went and bought that."", ""We went and spent this much money."", ""We went and spent that much money."" They knew we was poor. So I asked them ""Why everytime y'all come over here that y'all somehow brag about money?"" They was like ""GIIIIIIIRL ain't nobody trying to brag about money. Are you mad that you cant buy video games all the time LMFAO!!""  Always make fun of me about that.


June 3rd, 2018 I will be 21 years old. 

Here's my question about the 2 mil and everything that ➡Is this my fault? Am I in the wrong here because I used $29 of my SSI money to earn my 2 mil, that I did it behind everyone's back apparently, that I didn't even bother to let her help me apparently, that I was being greedy apparently, I didn't even bother to tell her apparently?

I'm an only child while he is the youngest of 2 sons and since he's only 3 years older than me, my mom and my aunt thought it'd be nice to make us spend time together. We got close, really close and were like inseparable. But when he turned 12 or 13, he did stop talking to me, all of sudden. He doesn't say hi to me when he and his family visit us. Hell, he doesn't even look at me when I open the door. A year ago, during New Year's Eve, we were sitting in front of each other during dinner and I was staring at him because he looks really good now that he lost the acne. He noticed what I was doing so I moved my gaze to one of my cousin's baby and when I looked back at him, he avoided my gaze.

I told my friends about him and they say that he must be embarrassed about something but I dunno about what or why since he never did something weird or bad to me. 

All of my other relatives told me he would start talking to me again when he got older and mature. But oh surprise: he is now 20 and at college, and he still doesn't talk to me and avoid my gaze. ",ND

I know he’s been involved with that for a long time, even when he was married with my mom, but he doesn’t know I know all that. 

One day I asked him to answer me sincerely what was that, or just say nothing if he didn’t want to. He lied to me but I said nothing.

257,"Best friend has a bf and is MIA
I want to start a thread for people who have best friends/friends who have been MIA as a possible result from having a bf/gf. Please share your stories and give advice to those who post. 

So here’s my story: 

So my best friend of five years has had a boyfriend for over a year now. However, she’s recently been MIA. There has been times where I hadn’t seen her for two weeks or maybe a month, but this time it was a lot more. Despite living a few minutes away from me, I hadn’t seen her in 2 months!! Every time I asked her to hang out she would say that she was busy, but she wouldn’t suggest meeting another time. We barely texted around this time either, I was the one that mostly initiated the conversations. Although she was busy, she was able to meet up with her boyfriend plenty of times who happens to live an hour away from her. She would always post photos of them together in social media and I would honestly feel upset. Eventually, I asked her to hang out again and she said that she had plans to go to the movies that night with someone else(not her bf), but that I could join. So we went to the movies and she dropped me off to my house right after the movie because she had to wake up early the next day. So we didn’t really talk (since it’s the movies) and I couldn’t address how I felt about not seeing her since there was someone else there as well. Also, the only reason I saw her that one time is because I asked her to hang out. If I hadn’t texted her, then she wouldn’t have invited me and I wouldn’t have seen her. After that I didn’t see her for a while either and I wanted to meet with her in person so that I could speak to her. A couple weeks later we finally saw each other. The first thing I told her was how I felt upset because I felt like she wasn’t making much of an effort to even talk to me or see me. I told her that we should see each other more and she agreed. She then caught me off guard by stopping me and saying “I know what you’re going to say.” She claims that she knew and that she had been feeling guilty for the past months. She then said that those months were kind of hectic because her bf was going through something. But that’s it... she didn’t apologize and it just doesn’t sit right with me. All she said was how she felt guilty and then mentioned something about her boyfriend to justify her behavior for the past months. We hung out for a couple of hours, however her bf kept calling her and she’d answer his calls during this time. She’d recently gone on a short vacation and I didn’t know when she’d returned to town until I saw a photo on Instagram of her and her boyfriend together. I’m honestly very mad and I feel as though I can’t say anything because I had already mentioned it. What pisses me off more is when she had just gone on vacation for two days and posted a photo of her boyfriend on social media with the caption “It’s only been 2 days and I miss you sooo much!!” Like are you seriously kidding me, you hadn’t seen your friend in more than two months... I’m honestly so mad and I feel like I can’t tell her without her getting mad. She’ll probably get defensive since it involves her bf and since I mentioned it before. She’s honestly the only best friend I have and I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m starting to resent them and I don’t want to. Is there any advice that anyone can give me? ",ND

262,"Why is it so hard to just be empathetic?
Today, I failed miserably at baking a key lime pie. Filling was way too loose, meringue wouldn't whip, crust cracked, just a terrible time overall. And then my mom comes over and instead of comforting me or something a normal human being would do, says ""Better luck next time,"" with the tone of a carny trying to get a six year old away from his ring toss booth. I got even more upset, and that seemed to genuinely confuse her.

All I wanted in that moment was for her to say ""I'm sorry your pie didn't turn out, it'll be okay."" Or just something a human being with emotions would say to their upset daughter.

This even just kind of exemplified what I get sick of in people. Even if you don't ""get it"" why is it so hard to realize that people have different priorities from you? Especially people who are depressed or have other mental illnesses. It can be a triumph for us to get out of bed some days. If we share an achievement or (more rarely) a failure with you, be with us in that emotion for a moment. Why is that so hard for ""normal"" people?

Oh yeah. Because all the empathetic people are depressed.",D
263,"Just ranting.
It fucking annoys me when I tell someone I’m depressed and they say “why.” Like, when someone tells you they have the fucking flu do you ask why? How are people so dumb about mental illness?

I have people who say “yeah, I was depressed before,” and I’m like “what did you do” and they say it just went away. Seriously? You just woke up and it was fucking gone? Poof? 

Everyone always has their golden fix for me too. My mom tells me to drink lemon water. My dad says “stop worrying so much.” My coworker says “meditate.” Exercise. Volunteer. Quit your job and go do what you love (which is what, exactly?). 

I try so, so, so hard to not be depressed. But if I’m not pushing myself 120% to stop it, it comes back, and I’m back to square one. And I can’t, I just can’t keep doing it. It’s just like pushing a rock up a mountain with no peak. 

My favorite are the people who say “you need to let go. Just let go of the past.” These are the people that post dumbass quotes on Facebook and Instagram who haven’t experienced a day of depression in their lives. Let go of WHAT? What does that even fucking mean? I ask these people to go into detail, and they don’t. They act like a fucking monk, and just say, “You just have to let go.”

265,"Doctor taking me off meds Cold Turkey
Hi everyone, I've been on Prozac (Fluexetine) since 9th grade. I am a 2nd year student in college now. For the past few years I've been upped from 10mg, to 20mg, and now 40mg. I've been on 40 mg for 3 years. When I went to my doctor it was only to tell him during a check up that I was comfortable with my medicine and dosage, so he would send more prescriptions to my pharmacy. 

During my last visit, I expected it to be a quick and simple check up as usual, but instead he said he was prescribing me ""3 more months"" of  40 mg Prozac then making me stop cold Turkey because ""being on Prozac for more than 6 months is bad"". 

I don't understand because he has been constantly renewing my prescription for years and never said anything about tapering off or stopping. I once went a month cold turkey during a health insurance issue and around the 3rd week I had attempted suicide. 

And addressing the ""3 months"" he promised, I was quickly informed the pharmacy was only given 1 month of medicine for me 

I've been admitted to a mental hospital by my mother after I got raped and beaten, because I drank a lot of alcohol for a few days.

I've been to several therapists. I've been rationing my pills 1 every 2 days, and my mother and fiancée who I live with have already seen a drastic change in my behavior. I feel awful because they give me such a nice and comfortable life but I am still depressed. I don't know what to do when I have no more antidepressants after 5+ years and then going cold Turkey. I'm afraid my brain chemistry will convince me to do something stupid and damaging to myself again.",D
266,"Ever Feel FB ""Friends"" Are Lying Out Their Asses?
For real. How the fuck can people post about life being great, life is so good, and being blessed? It's like they want to rub your nose in it how wonderful their life is. While you're wallowing in alcohol/drugs, in a room by yourself, contemplating suicide. 

Sometimes, I just want to call people out on this bullshit but I don't post on FB anymore. No possible way these people are that happy and enjoy life so much. Is it just narcissists? Or are people really this happy and get all the luck in the world?",D
267,"How to break up with my depressed/suicidal girlfriend?
I’m in a tough position... I fell for a girl over 6 months ago and we’ve been dating since. It’s faded for me at least, and I don’t feel the same way I did at all, but from what she’s told me her feelings for me have only gotten stronger and we’ve already hit the “I love you” stage. I still care for her as a person and there’s nothing bad between us nor do we argue, but it’s just not what it was and I feel like I’ve needed to move on for the past 2-3 months. My issue with this is the fact that she’s both depressed and has been suicidal in the past (not things I knew off the bat, but learned towards the beginning). She has 1 real friend and a sibling she’s close to, but aside from that she doesn’t get along with her family. She’s told me before I’m really all she has, but not in a desperate way (although I think it is that too). I don’t really know how to tell her or what to be cautious of because this is the first time I’ve dated someone like this. I know it’s a shitty situation but I need to move on in a way that leaves her the least impacted or in the best way I can. I haven’t done anything like cheat on her or hurt her emotionally but I know this will crush her either way...",D

269,"Only 7 cigarettes today
This sounds really stupid but I’ve never ever practiced self control with smoking and I usually smoke anywhere from 20 to 30 cigarettes a day. I tried for the first time today to cut back and used my iPhone stop watch to try and wait 3 hours before another smoke. Drank tons and tons of water. Currently I have only had 6 today but I’m putting in the cautionary one more just in case I do before I go to bed. I dunno if it’s ok to be proud of yourself on Reddit but, that’s a cool Little win for the day in the mind of a depressive. Hope you all are fighting the good fight.

Cheers

I’m been having thoughts and feelings lately and I want to compare them to when other people decided to take the plunge. There are days when I’m happy but most nights and some days are not as good. Recently I’ve been struggling and I try to remind myself that it’s not so bad and I could have it worse etc. But anyway. I don’t want to go into a lot of detail or get really personal but for context I’m a college senior. I went to a psychiatrist when I was young (like 7 or 8) and I took medicine for depression but they made me aggressive according to my mom so I didn’t take them long. I haven’t seen anyone, including a school counselor, since then. However in late high school/early college I struggled with self harm. These days I just feel so tired and empty and I just want to sleep. ",D

273,"I need to get this out. Feel free to ignore it.(Potential Triggers: Domestic and parental abuse, self harm, bullying, substance abuse etc. Avoiding detail AMAP)
I am so sick of trying to just survive each day. I want more than anything to go out and live my life. I want a job, an apartment, a pet... but instead I’m stuck living with my grandparents because I’m at the point where my agoraphobia is so bad I can BARELY leave my bed. I don’t think I have felt “happy” for more than 10 minutes at any given time in the last 6 months. I applied to try to get a tattoo to cover some scars I have from when I got really bad, but they never contacted me again...so that reminder is always there making me feel sick and myself and taunting me to do it again just to numb the crap in my head. I’m trying to be a partner to this amazing guy I care a ton about, but I feel so emotionally shut down that I don’t even react to jokes or love anymore. I don’t even like when he cuddles me because his breath on my neck is a trigger...
Now, I do not have it as bad as a lot of other people. I grew up in a family with a loving (OCD) grandmother, a grandfather, and a (drug addict) mother who all always made sure I had food and a place to sleep. That alone is more than a lot of people get...but every time I try to talk to someone and they don’t respond to me I flip out at them because my mom didn’t want me to interrupt her high. When something goes SLIGHTLY wrong or is a SMIDGE out of place I panic because that’s all I had around me. When someone on the street spits I flinch because my ex’s favourite way to degrade me was to spit in my face while mocking me. When I go downtown I get anxious because that’s where I was publicly beating by a (different yet no les “charming”) ex. I avoid drinking now because I don’t want to fall into drinking to feel happy again and I definitely don’t want to add to my scars...but this is all I have known my whole life. Every time I try to take a step forward, improve myself, or even leave the house to do something I once enjoyed, it feels like the weight of every circumstance and bad decision in my life is right there to push me further into the dirt. The only ways I know how to make money aren’t things I want to do...the only people in my life I want to be around I can’t stand to be near...I feel like I have nothing left to hold onto and I’m drowning! I’d check into the hospital just to get away, but unless I were to actually make an attempt on my life they wouldn’t accept me (but at least we have free healthcare right?)... I just need a day of normal.....",D

277,"Anyone elses depression feel like this?
Good day, This might be weird but stick with me.

I suffered/suffer from depression. Basically from middle school to about a year ago when I finally started on medication.

The best way I could describe my depression is voices in my head saying mean and awful things to me, about me, about what other people are thinking or saying about me, turning positives into negatives etc. 

I started playing a game called Hellblade Senua's Sacrifice tonight and the their is a theme around psychosis, and the main character has many voices in her head. Here is the opening, (possible trigger warning?), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rob7C1lCYEI

As soon as I heard all the voices calling Senua names, putting her down, laughing at her etc. I was like holy shit that was me. I am not trying to say I have/had psychosis, I just thought that the voices thing felt like what I went through. My voice, telling me terrible things, spinning stories, like someone else in my head, working against me.

Anyone else feel like Senua/me? ",D

It makes me feel good for a little while, but eventually the happy feeling from laughter returns to feeling like crap.  ",D
279,"People are NOT who they seem.
I originally wrote a long post detailing the specifics of what just happened to me, but I decided not to. All I'm saying is, **don't** trust anybody. You have **zero** assurance that people who act nice and fine when you're around are really nice and fine towards you when your back's turned.

I wouldn't have known the true, judgmental, and frankly I have no fucking idea where in the ass of God did they pull all their judgmental shit - if I hadn't snooped and read text messages of my mother to other people. Hell, my own mother's in it, too!

""Hide the knife, he might stab our son (my stepfather)."" ""You're sick, go to a doctor for a checkup. You can't give up, please don't die. We pity your son. He can't survive without you. He'll burn all the money with booze. He'll be homeless and sleep on the streets.""

Jesus Fucking Christ. What in the actual fuck? I don't even drink. Jesus Christ. What the fuck. The judgment. Dear fucking Christ I could not believe nor comprehend how this people even came to whatever bullshit thought/idea they came to.

Suddenly, I'm back down to self-doubt and I can feel depression clawing at me, it's trying to rip me apart again. But, no more. I'm pushing it back. I've confirmed EVERYTIME, that family is my main source of toxicity. FUCK THAT.

I'm being ganged up on by everyone in this house, and their relatives, and every single one of my relatives. I once questioned if I was the one at fault. I mean, if EVERYBODY hated you, you're probably doing something wrong. UNLESS, you're just that damn unlucky and every single one of your relative is a fucking asshole. I've heard of those stories before, so it isn't impossible - and I think that's the case with me.

Jesus. For now, I'm playing the game they wanna play. They wanna be fake with me, I'll be fake with them. I act all fine and dandy around my mother and everyone else. I smile, I joke. All a facade. So when the right time comes, when I can finally burn bridges with them, **it will fucking hurt mom.** Mom, yes. Because everyone else would be glad I'm gone.

282,"I don’t want to be an adult anymore.
I’ve been struggling with my depression a lot lately and I really really wish I could turn to one of my parents to tell them how much I’m struggling. More importantly, I wish I could tell one of them and one of them cared.

I know I’m a decent disappointment to both of them for several reasons.

1) I haven’t had a decent job. I’ve been floating on jobs that get me less than five hours a week. 

2) I don’t have friends. Granted, that’s because my mother literally and intentionally isolated me so I have no social skills at all.

3) I have big dreams but zero motivation in life so I can’t even try to achieve them.

So what I’m trying to do is work on myself. 

Today I started a new (third, I now have three of these stupid things) job. I thought I did pretty good considering the store didn’t burn down and no one told me that I was a failure. But literally as soon as the sun set, I feel all my doubt and darkness telling that I’m lying to myself. That I’m being naive by thinking that I did well, that I was probably a huge burden to everyone else in the store. But I’m trying, so that has to count for something right? I went and got a third job on my own, so why don’t I feel like I should be proud of myself?

I have no friends. In fact, during 2017, I was so excited to have made a great friend and I was completely betrayed by them. The kind of betrayal where I walked away from a friendship and haven’t bothered reading the apologies they’ve sent me. I’ve tried reconnecting with friend that I had earlier in life, but I’m not doing so well. I feel like they will do something to me and then I’ll lose another friend. And logically, if I’m the only common factor in all my failed friendships, then I must be the problem, right? I must be the problem. I’m the problem. Maybe I’m not meant to have friends. 

And I’ve always had big dreams for myself. But because of how I was raised, I have no accountability. Because seriously, why bother trying if everything I do is going to be met with disapproval and anger? So I’ve been trying really hard to make myself follow at least one goal. I chose to go for my art. Problem being that with my depression crashing on me in waves, I’m really struggling to stick to my goal of one art post a day. I’m trying really hard but I’m so afraid that I’ll be the failure I was taught to be.



In all of this, I just really really wish I could quit trying to be an adult and go back to the days when I believed my mom when she said she loved me, I want to go back to when my dad wanted to help me talk things out so I could figure out what I was doing. I want to be able to call my mom up and tell her that I feel like a complete failure and that I can’t add to see my therapist and that I need help talking the darkness down. But if I call her, she’ll one-up me because I’m the biggest mistake of her life. Or worse, she’ll tell me that I should try (fill in the blank with whatever bs Facebook depression fix is trending). I want to be able to call my mom and say hey, I got another job and I’m excited. I want her to tell me that she’s proud of me. 

I really want to have a conversation with my dad that doesn’t involve the phrase “well get over it”. ‘Hey dad, I’m full of regret and turmoil’ ‘ugh just get over it’ well excuse me sir for being by the reality that I just pulled a mulan and cut all my hair off so that I could get another job. I went from having shoulder length hair that made me feel good about myself to hair that’s half an inch long and highlights everything about my face that gives me horrible anxiety. Maybe I’m really hurting because I went in to work yesterday and two of my managers greeted me with ‘ew gross, what happened to your hair?’ And now I feel like I’m as ugly as I think I am.

I really miss being a kid when I could pretend that my world wasn’t on fire or that I wasn’t drowning.

And I don’t know how to make any of the darkness back up so that I can breathe.

I really wish that I could see my therapist this week. ",D

So this is my story about a severe depression and anxiety I have been experiencing these months. 
TLDR, we kinda broke up back in April, we had some issues regarding me being a prick. But, she forgave me as we have a perfect relationship (that's right, I do think it's marvelous). But for some important reason that I don't wanna give details in, we can't be together anymore.
So, I started having anxiety attacks, and all my world was like hell, it was so bad, I felt like I had to do something about it.
Anyways, I am fighting to be back again with her, and she also is waiting for me.
We all dream about things or situations where we would allegedly be happy with: money, being successful.. all that kind of stuff. 
Here's what I have learned: When I dream about all this stuff, at the end the only thing, I mean, my only desire, the only thing that I crave in this world, and which I would be crushed to not have, is her.
I'm a person who deeply depends on others, I previously gave myself into deep friendships, but after all, and after all experience, my only friendship and relationship I'm keeping with is my girlfriend.
She literally is my everything regarding my happiness, and me being alive. 

Here's the summary: I wanna go back with my girlfriend, and I am depressed and sad if I'm not with her. I know we'll be hopefully soon together, but as the meantime, I feel like my days are worthless and my life is meaningless.

285,"Desperate for advice or input; I lost and am losing everything held dear to me right now due to multiple reasons, and would just like to hear some different recommendations
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO I DONT KNOW WHERE I WENT WRONG OR HOW TO FEEL BETTER!!

I've typed this out way too many times so I'm gonna do my best to sum it up as short as I can:

Last week me and my gf of 10 and a half months broke up, i was devestated. In that little time I have experienced more love, more of life than ever before and it felt like we'd been together forever. I thought, maybe we would work things out on our own and get back together when the time was right, even though i knew it was a stretch, but i was also okay with just being friends if that was what the world had planned. 2 days after the break up im talking to both of my best friends who are also (kinda?) friends with her, and they both tell me that she basically told them she had absolutely no intention of ever getting back with me because she wanted to ho around without the commitment of a relationship. She also openly bragged to one of them that she had cheated on me multiple times during our relationship. This all made me very angry and on top of that hurt. The same night just after finding all of this out I find out from my other friend that she had called her and bragged about hooking up with this one kid who, during our entire relationship, she told me she hated and that we BOTH already had bad history with, and fooled around. Then later (AGAIN) she goes on instagram live with my bestfriend who is kinda being fake just to see how she really is and openly brags about blocking me (which added to the hurt cause i had done nothing but try to respect her wishes since the split in hopes that we could at least part on good terms ya know) , saying that i was 'fucking crazy' and that she never wanted anything to do with me ever again. There's more in terms of details but thats the basic general idea of the past week for me.

I dont know how i feel or what to say.
I feel hurt and i feel abandoned and i feel stupid and i feel not good enough and i feel like a complete fuck up i feel so fucking awful its not even funny. Im losing my friends because my stupid brain cant get over this and im constantly going to them to talk about it because that's the way i like to deal with stuff, but they've heard the same thing one too many times and i get that i just dont know what else to do. Im tired of thinking about it, im tired of not being able to confront her but my friends say its not a good idea because its not gonna do anything but make her think even higher of herself for having fucked me up so badly and wont at all make her change her ways. I want to completely forget but at the same time a part of me wants to work everything out just so i can mean something to this person who meant absolutely everything to me at one point again, WHY?? 
Why does my brain, or heart, or whatever still crave attention from her, or maybe even her herself, even after knowing all of this? Why am i so fucking pathetic? What can I do to move on that doesn't involve just ignoring the problem and moving forward but rather coming to peace with it and myself and blossoming?

Please, all and every opinion or suggestion is welcome. Thank you if you took the time to read this and I wish everybody the best of luck with your own problems no matter what they be. May peace of mind and soul find you all.

290,"My boring sob story
Family members told me all the time that being an adult is shit and I should make the most of being a kid. So when depression hit me I thought it was normal, but it didn’t feel “right.” I wasn’t upset all the time, it was just like a flat misery sort of feeling.

Things started to feel odd for me, certain sounds and smells and silly things like the wind of my face felt wrong. Like they’d be toned down somehow. Eventually I became completely disconnected from my emotions, save for the occasional moment when I actually find something funny. I’ve been on two types of medication and had therapy too, neither of which did anything for me. 

I didn’t notice myself become so gradually withdrawn from everything. Now going to the shop or getting the bus is something I’d rather not do. Things I’d do every day. My social life went backwards as well as my social skills. Now I’m afraid to talk to people. I literally reject girls I’m interested in on the spot, before I even have chance to fuck it up myself. Things that I would do without thinking now take encouragement and energy. 

Then came the cynicism. Belief that nobody out there was pure and everything they did was for their own personal gain. Suppose it’s true in a sense but I wish I didn’t have this “paint everybody with the same brush” mindset.
It’s hard to believe I’m the same person at times. It’s been 7 years now and I’ve had enough. Just dunno what to do. I feel like I’ve tried everything. Can’t help but feel I’m partly responsible, for buying into the shit I told myself. ",D

Hey, haven't been here before but I had a quick scroll and this feels like the right sub to vent to. I'm 18 from the UK, I've had a rough educational life (I alway talked, went in high with my friends, got in minor trouble that kinda thing). I fucked up college in the second year of my 2 year diploma course and got excluded for the same kind of shit previously mentioned but on a larger scale, this really fucked me up as I thought I'd end up doing nothing with my life when I really wanted to do something with it. 10 weeks ago I got a job and a paid for graduates course which pays out over £1100 per month after tax which is incredible for me, it's a job I love, work hard at and it's exactly the path I want to take in life career-wise. So I've been given a second start, I have money, great friends, a good social life and my life is on track but I still can't quite feel complete. I'm very social anxious and this affects my everyday life but I push through it, I have to. I smoke week almost everyday and I've been smoking for about 5 years now. The problem is, I still have a void that I can't fill and I can never really feel that happy by myself. I love my metal and I'm a huge music fan, I used to play a lot of games but I've stopped caring so much now. Sometimes I find it hard to enjoy things as much as I used to. I feel exhausted at home as I don't sleep much and the anxiety takes it out of me until I walk through the door. It feels as if it's getting worse and I don't know what to do and I don't even know why I feel this way. Sometimes it can get quite bad where I won't even feel like doing anything but pulling bongs with the TV on in the background as the day is just too much to handle sometimes.

*trigger warning*

Hi everyone. I'm sorry if I'm doing this wrong. This is my first time visiting this subreddit, and so I don't know what's generally expected or done on here. Let me just get into this. 

I'm 22 and I've never experienced depression. I'm a Psychology major and I've taken classes over the topic, but I know reading about it can only give me so much insight. The reason I'm posting on here is because I have a 12 year old cousin who tried cutting herself the other day. She's depressed, says she wants to die, and I am so, so worried about her. She lives a few hours from me and is being watched closely right now, but I plan on going out to visit her this weekend. 

To be honest, she has a horrible living situation. My aunt (her mom) is awful. To my aunt, every problem can be solved by God, she's financially fucked and letting it out on my cousins, and she's extremely dismissive of my cousins feelings, needs, and emotions. It also doesn't help that my cousin is adopted, and I know she just feels detached from her own family. 

Anyways, I know that there's no such thing as simply getting your advice on how to fix my cousins depression. I know how complex of an issue this is. What I want to know from you all is if there is anything I can do this weekend to just show her that things can get better. My little cousin has always looked up to me, and I plan on taking her out to do some of the things that she always wants to do (like go to the park, make slime, whatever 12 year olds like). But is there anything extra I can do? Is there anything that you all wish someone told you? Or maybe even something you wish they didn't? 

I would really appreciate any tips or advice you all have for me this weekend. I know my cousin has a very long road ahead of her, but I want to do anything I can to make it easier. Thank you. 

tl;dr my 12 year old cousin is depressed and attempting to hurt herself. I'm going to visit her this weekend. Is there anything I can do (or shouldn't do), that might at least show her that things can get better. ",D

I feel strong and motivated. 

And then I have to go home. I am no longer in the company of people who love me, so I start feeling anxious. I start believing they actually fucking hate me. I lose it. I hate being alone because my horrible thoughts are a lot easier to hear over the silence of no one talking. ",D

304,"Why depression is, and isn't like a skinned knee: Some thoughts I had that I wanted to share
I was just pondering depression, and I decided to jot down what I was thinking. It's sort of a good way to put words to what it feels like to suffer from depression.

____________________________________

Why it IS like a skinned knee:


Depression usually comes in episodes for me, and a lot of people I've talked to. Sometimes I'll be doing okay, and then have a really bad day, or even a bad week. 

These episodes are sort of like skinning your knee. When you were little, skinning your knee feels like the absolute worst thing in the world. You think, ""OW, THIS HURTS SO MUCH! WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?!"" 

You feel so helpless. 

When you're an adult and skin your knee, you know what to do. You know that you're supposed to clean it, and put a bandage on it. And that's exactly what you do; you don't make a fuss. 

But, even though you clean it and bandage it, it's of course still going to hurt. It's a cut. You just ignore the pain, though, because you've already taken care of it, and there's not much else you can do beyond that. You just have to live with the fact that it's going to hurt for a while.


Depression is the exact same way. When it happens, you know what you should do to handle it. The best way, backed by science and research, is what we've all heard countless times: Exercise, eat healthy, do something nice for yourself, clean your living space, listen to happy music, watch TV shows that make you happy, etc.


So you know to do this stuff. But of course, it's not going to magically feel 100% better right off the bat. There's still that emotional pain there, just like the way a skinned knee stings. But you've already done everything you can to take care of it, so you have to live with it and wait patiently for the pain to go away.


______________________________________________


Why depression ISN'T like a skinned knee:


Most people know that depression has a way of demotivating sufferers. Things you once enjoyed no longer interest you. Nothing seems like it has a point.


But this also affects your drive to treat your depression. When you skin your knee, you just take care of it right away, you don't give any second thought to it. It's just what you do. With depression, you know that you should be exercising, eating healthy, listening to happy music, cleaning, etc. But you don't. What's the point? 


The difference is, that depression makes you NOT want to get better, or more accurately, not care about getting better. Sometimes, you're just apathetic and nihilistic, ""What's the point? I don't care. Getting better is too much effort.""
Sometimes, you just want to wallow in your own despair. For me, when I feel this way, it's because I feel worthless and self-loathing. I think, ""I deserve to feel this way. I deserve this emotional pain that I'm going through. I don't deserve to feel better, or to be happy.""


That's the vicious cycle that depression uses to keep you down.


If you are reading this and have depression, I hope this helps you understand your own illness a little more clearly. If you're reading this and you don't have depression, I hope this gives you a good account of what it's like, so you can empathize with people who have depression.


Stay safe, everyone.

305,"The Irony of Loneliness in an Overpopulated World
As I spend more time in the presence of depression, I've tried to apply a further focus to understand what's actually going on in my head. Dealing with the sudden appearance of depression has been a nightmare and a half to deal with to say the least. So in response, I regularly attempt to interpret the spiral of self loathing thoughts and whirlwind of emotions that march throughout my mind. 

My initial reaction to a diagnosis of major depression and multiple failed suicide attempts has been to run away from everything that reeks of painful memories, both theoretically and literally:

* I write this post 7,000 kilometres from my home country, in Japan, where I aim to live for the next couple of years. 
* ‎I've ghosted those whom I use to call my close friends.
* I left all social media in order to avoid contacting people that I knew, and because looking at how happy other people were brought me down. 
* ‎I changed my image drastically over the past year as an outward expression of the fact that I'm trying to change as a person.

It's here in Japan that I've come to a terrifying realisation. I can't run from depression. Here I am, in a country where people speak a totally different language and immersed in a totally different culture to my own, writing a post about depression. 

Recently, I was walking the streets in search for job opportunities when I sunk into a depressed mood and began thinking about my place in the world (which always turns out well). Nothing actually matters. We work in order to pay rent, in order to stay in the same place, so that we can reliably keep a job so that we can pay rent. It's in this meaninglessness that humans as social beings look to others for comfort. Our lives are but a meaningless speck in an expanding universe. That's quite the depressing thought... And it is. But why is it that when another body's lying on top of mine, or when I'm held in a warm embrace, this thought doesn't have any impact on me?

I've done quite a bit of thinking by myself,  and have talked to a bunch of people from back in the psychiatric ward on what 'fixes' us. And the unfortunate answer for most of us is... Nothing. We can't be fixed. It's just how our minds work. But what if we don't have to be fixed? The hardest part about depression for me, is the intensity of the loneliness I feel. When I'm at my worst, I'm so focused on my own loneliness and the meaninglessness of my relationships, that the few connections I do have, I dismiss. Now, this isn't the case for all people suffering from depression. For a lot of people, their negative emotions are driven by a sense of worthlessness,  meaninglessness or sadness. 

But the general consensus is, although we can't 'fix' ourselves, we can have people around us to support us when we're at our lowest. And it makes sense that as social beings, human intimacy provides us with a safety net for when depression's hitting us the hardest. 

Unfortunately for most of us, the type of physical and emotional intimacy that we strive for is unobtainable. In my life, depression's caused me to push away the people that I've spent time building connections with, and has limited the amount of contact I've had with strangers and people that I COULD connect with.

I think it's ironic. It's ironic that in such an overpopulated world, depression is such a big issue. We're the people that need intimacy the most, so you'd think we'd be in a position where intimacy is more readily available. But that's not how the world works. Our lives are still meaningless. We still hate ourselves. And we're still alone. ",D
306,"I haven't felt anything in over a month.
I have struggled with depression for a few years now, and I was doing really well. I met a girl online that seemed absolutely perfect, and she made me feel truly happy for the first time since I was little. In October, she just stopped replying to me. She sent a message a few weeks later faking to be a family member and lied about committing suicide. I just feel nothing anymore after that.",D

People are not perfect and I push them away or worse, I don't and they use me or tease me forever because apparently I'm too kind and I act like a stray animal. What should I do? I'm so lost. How can I escape my dreams? I'm 26 and I don't have any close friends and I end up talking to my cats or my plushy because interacting with humans makes me incredibly tense. I'm on meds.

No anti-depressant works for me. Every medication makes me miserable and sick unless it is a stimulant, and I don't want to be stuck on stimulants. I used to drink as a crutch and now I can't.


My husband and I were separated and moved back in together. He is an addict too and going through withdrawal, so he is extra-sensitive. My ex decided that it would be a great time to blackmail me with Facebook statuses and tag my husband in them. I didn't tell my spouse about the blackmail because of the potential fallout, because things were finally good. Now I realize I just hurt him worse. Needless to say... he is pissed. It just makes things worse. 


I have no motivation at work. Therapy is not working and I need a new therapist, but I don't have the energy or self-love to care enough to do anything about my issues. I am in a black hole when everyone thinks I live a charmed life. I have been depressed since I was five years old and I don't know how long I can hold on without losing it.

What do I even do? I'm withdrawing from stims myself, and I feel completely useless and hopeless. I'm too lazy to be suicidal these days, but I don't enjoy life anymore. I cry all the time. I live in my head. I don't know what I can gain from posting here, but someone... please help.",D

I'm constantly on the outside of the conversations taking place. I'm often left behind during break and if a coworker shows or shares something with the other while I'm there,I will be ignored. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm cool enough to laugh and joke with but not cool enough for anything else.

313,"Anyone ever look back at their younger years and wonder how they used to be such a joyful person?
I saw a post on here about someone remembering a feeling of emptiness since they were five and just not knowing it was depression.  For me it's the opposite.  I was always a super joyful kid, and maybe a little too hyper.  (I was that annoying kid when I was 10-11).  Then around seventh grade I started to withdrawal from the world slightly, and just talked a little less than average.  This seemed all fine at the time, it made me a more likable person.  But I think that was the beginning.  I finally realized my lack of a friend group because of how I acted when I was younger during third quarter that year.  It wasn't bad depression, but it only got worse from there.  My Dad turned from mean to abusive starting next year, and my mom started to be disappointed with everything I do.  My parents don't even know anything about me besides a few keywords because they haven't held a conversation with me since I was 11.  The only person who I can say genuinely cares for me is my best friend, and he doesn't even know I am depressed.  I don't see a reason why I am, so why should I explain that to someone who is much more depressed than I am?  By the time I turned 14 I can say I was depressed.

316,"isnt it kind of crazy when people who actually are not clinically depressed say they want to die or are depressed for fun, when you are really dealing with those feelings for real?
There are people at my work place who clearly are not clinically depressed but tag and share memes like they are lonely or depressed or just say they want to die in a funny way, when everyday is a huge challenge for me in terms of forcing myself to be alive and conform to the societal norms. This usually never gets to me because many people dont actually get what it means to be depressed. Even depressed people experience things in a spectrum. However, when I feel like I am falling off the wagon and I see these seemingly normal treat suicidal thoughts/coping mechanisms of genuinely depressed people/melancholy as fun memes and have a good laugh when all those things are part my own personal hell, I just go completely bonkers and I do not really know why.

317,"Falling for someone you have no chance to be with
Warning: Super long read

Have you ever fallen for someone that you know you have absolutely no chance with?

It’s been 4 years since I’ve fallen for a girl back in college, which ended up in heartbreak and depression because she already found someone else. I’ve lost all motivations and my passion for arts (I’m an art student), failed my thesis which sent me into another dark place, ’friends’ were not even there to help me get up, and for the remaining years I had in college, the thing that kept me going are my parents, I just wanted to survive for them. I’ve lost all emotions, the flame that was once burning in my heart, the excitement I had when I was a freshman. I graduated college 7 months ago and found work not related to the course I took up, it felt really low, but I just wanted to survive. Training for work now, didn’t want to make friends again, had one, but he didn’t liked the people so he left in a few weeks, the only thing in my mind was to focus and be better for this job to survive. Avoided lunch and hanging out with workmates, and didn’t really reveal much about myself aside from having a mundane life. The trainers were aware of my introversion and decided to have random sitting arrangements every week so we could get to know our workmates more, and I could get to talk about other stuff aside from work. 3 weeks in training and still, I didn’t made any connections, I only help out my workmates professionally, point out mistakes and the next step they should take.

I get to be sit mates with the liveliest girl in training, playful and have a contagious ’happy’ aura(?). There were also a few talks and laughs about work related stuff, but I didn’t really made efforts to start it, she was always the one that engages first (and that’s because she’s an extrovert and does this to everyone anyways). Being around her, hearing her voice, seeing her smile felt something, it felt like the flame that I lost 4 years ago came back. But, what made me fell the most is that she’s intelligent as well and speaks in English flawlessly (I live in a country outside US). I can also relate to her because she suffers from clinical depression and requires therapy sessions every now and then (everyone in training knows this anyways because she told the class from the get-go). I didn’t really asked her out for lunch or coffee, I really wanted to so I could get to know her better and be friends with her, be her guide in her darkest days, but my introversion and over thinking always gets the best of me.

There were only a few times she joined me and my friend during a coffee break where I found out a few things about her. There were times that I see the sadness beyond her smile, and times where her depression was clearly visible and affected me greatly. I always think about scenarios - if the conditions were right - where I get to talk with her and lend a helping hand, at the end of the day they only remain as thoughts. I know she doesn’t think about me like how I think about her. Every time our shift ends, I leave the office quickly and ignore the feelings I have for her, my mind is at a constant battle on whether or not to ask her for lunch, ask her if she’s ok. It’s even worse at night, whenever I see her late night tweets about her depression, a part of me just wants to be there for her, and the other part gives me the realization of how pathetic I am and that I don’t deserve her. I know that she had an ex-bf that broke her heart, and currently has a gf (she’s bi). Yet, she still gives me inspiration in every photo I take. I really don’t know what is wrong with me, I’m being tormented by my own mind and I still like it. Knowing that she already has someone in her heart, yet still seeing her depressed at times (and looking at her tweets), really makes me want to step up and do something, but held back by my own tormented soul.

Next week would be the last week in training, after that we’re going to get split up into teams and do actual work, but still go back to class to share our experience and reflect upon them. One could only hope for a miracle that I gain the strength and courage to talk to her more and be a part of her life. I really hate this feeling, yet this pain fuels my passion even more.",D

I've had suicidal ideations for as long as I can remember. Despite this, I always wrote off my depression as not being a problem.

Only I find that whenever I spend time with a friend, they end up annoying the shit out of me. Each one for a different reason. One talks about herself too much, one is too positive and gushy, one only ever talks about the past, the other only wants to hang out and drink. When I’m with them, I just find myself wishing I could be alone.

I know the problem is with me, and that I’m sabotaging my relationships (as I always do and have done for many years). I feel guilty about it, especially knowing that I’m lucky to even have friends. But the truth is, I find people exhausting, and whenever I’m with them I just feel lonelier that when I’m alone. I end up getting snappy.

In that year off I didn’t grow as a person and I feel empty all I do is sleep and play video games and go out once every two months to hangout. My parents are complaining that I have no girl friend , no life and I’m anti social. I’m not anti social I just feel so empty and lost that I don’t feel like doing anything anymore.

331,"Sick of rejection
Met someone on an app we seemed to click and talked all night till like 4am, same the next night and the night after that etc. Honestly for the first time in ages I thought Id done it and found someone who liked me aswell and we could hang out and have some fun, even just over the summer Id have been happy with that. 

After more talking we met, we drove round and spent a few hours just chilling and talking it was fun but something wasnt right. I have these little games I play to kind of 'test the waters', nothing creepy just some fun light flirting like a play full punch to the arm or lean myself a bit closer in watching a video or something, harmless stuff but the reactions tell you the story. Long story short it wasnt the story I was hoping for, nothing was reciprocated and there was just no positive body language (I know im sounding like some sort of socially awkward overly analytical weirdo here but trust me its just the best way I can describe it over text).

So it gets to nearly 11 he starts yawning talking about being up for work, fair enough weve been out 4 hours so I drop him home, says text me when you get back so I do and sure enough the generic one word 'haha' responses start and that was it.

The thing is its not the first time, it happens all the time, I rarely find anyone who actually has proper chat with me (always just 'fuck now dude?' or that type of crap) so I start getting feelings and they seem to like me, we meet and it all seems to fall apart aftwerwards. Your just gonna have to trust me that im not creepy, I dont make sexual advances, I can hold convo, make people laugh, everyone always seems happy to spend a good few hours with me and not want to go home yet when they do it all comes crashing down. 

Wtf is wrong with me :/",D
332,"Why do I feel like I don't know myself anymore
I keep struggling with depression and I feel like it's stripping away all the things that make me... me.  I used to be a good student, used to write stories about adventure and life, used to play sports, used to enjoy hanging out with friends and now I'm nothing.  I've been losing parts of myself until all that's left of me is misery.  All I feel like doing anymore is laying in my bed and staring at the ceiling or if I'm feeling particularly bad I cut myself.

I am realizing that the only reason I haven't killed myself is because my dog loves me. My first marriage ended over 7 years ago because my wife choose someone else over me.

She's amazing. I helped rescue her after her owner passed away and I could never do that to her again. She's 11 now and loves me. I read a story online about a dog passing away and I thought ""if little Dixie goes, I'll go too."" And it took hours before I realized that I don't think I'm kidding. I work only so that bills get paid. I'll never pay off my student loan debt. If I go soon, my nephew won't have any memories of me.

Funny enough, I had planned on hanging out and doing some reading in a cafe today... only to never leave the house. All this time, I've been thinking how much I yearn to have someone, anyone, physically check in. Or a partner to cuddle with, hug, and hold me tight.... but all that just fades into the empty void. 

I used to be Christian, and used to pray. Now that I'm not, I'm realizing how truly alone I am in dealing with all this. My friends all live in the city center. They have jobs and livelihoods. Ultimately, I have to physically do things by myself. No one's gonna save me. It's heartbreaking. Physically, I'm just so alone.",D
336,"Opened up to a ""friend"" about my depression. It could've gone better.
Hello, Reddit.

I've never posted here before. I'm a bit nervous about sharing this story (I'm very shy, even anonymously), so I want to thank you in advance for taking the time to read it. I'm hoping that just getting it off my chest will help, even if only a little. Also, I'm sorry if this post rambles on a bit or is incoherent at all, I'm not in the best state of mind at the moment.

Earlier today, during our school's lunch break, I opened up to somebody I trusted about my depression and anxiety. I've been on a steep downward spiral recently, and this person had taken notice that something was wrong. She sat me down, grabbed us a couple of sodas, and told me to spill my guts. Normally, I would have simply told her that everything was fine, and made some lame excuse like ""I didn't sleep well last night"" or ""I'm just worried about my exam scores"". But this was the first time that anybody had ever reached out to try and help, so I decided to be truthful. I thanked her for offering to listen, and explained that I had never shared this with anybody else, so I might struggle to fully express myself. She was understanding, and told me to take as much time as I needed. 

I was very careful not to unload everything on her, I basically told her exactly what I said at the start of this post: that I struggle with depression and anxiety, and that it's been getting a lot worse recently. Initially, it seemed like it was going well. She had several follow-up questions, some of which I wasn't entirely comfortable answering. However, for the first time in years I felt a genuine sense of hope, and felt like someone actually cared about me, so I answered them anyway. Eventually, she asked me what was causing all of this. I explained that while there are certainly things that contribute to my depression on a day-to-day basis, at the root of it, there isn't really a reason. It's just who I am, almost as if it's hardwired into my brain. It's hard to explain. Do any of you understand what I'm talking about?

Anyway, this is where things took a turn. While I was trying to explain that, she stopped me and said: ""I'm sorry, I can't do this. I offered to help cause I thought you were just having girl problems, or school problems, or something. I didn't realize you were totally emo. We're not in high school anymore. Besides, you're a guy, just toughen up"". That last part stung. I knew that was a common sentiment in our society, but to hear it coming from her, someone I've been friends with since high school, really took me by surprise. I didn't know what to say, so I didn't say anything. I just kind of looked down at my lap. We sat quietly for a moment, until she got up and started gathering her things. As she started to walk away I said: ""I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable, I wasn't trying to do that."" She looked back at me and said: ""Look, a big reason I'm friends with you is because of your positive attitude. It's infectious, and I love that about you. But if that's really just a mask, then you should probably just keep the mask on if we're going to continue being friends."", and then she left. 

She texted me a few hours later and said: ""I hope you're able to move past your issues so our friendship can move forward"". I haven't responded, and don't plan to. I cry myself to sleep at night enough as it is without also worrying about maintaining a fake personality for her. I probably won't be opening up to anyone like that again anytime soon (except, of course, to all of you wonderful people on the internet). Deep down, I know that most of the people in my life wouldn't react the way she did. But I just don't think I can build up the motivation to try it, not when I struggle just to get up in the morning.

I want to thank you all again. Not just for reading my story, but for being a part of this community. Depression and anxiety really suck, and nobody should have to suffer through them alone.

...I'm gonna go hug my pillow now. ",D

338,"Whenever I try to change my life these thoughts pop up
Had depression and anxiety for years and have many times tried to make changes to my life. But I can't shake the thought that says: ""why bother?"". ""Why suffer through all that extra pain that change requires just for a long shot chance of a normal life?"".

And on top of that I don't even know if I want a normal life! I Often think that the only thing that separates myself from the ""normal people"" (in lack of a better word,) is that the ""normal people"" have an easier time fooling themselves, a bigger capacity for self-delucions. And if happiness can only come from convincing yourself of existential lies, I'm not sure if that (happiness) is for me...

Has anyone else struggled with these thoughts? Does anyone know how to motivate yourself to change when it seems so futile?",D

340,"When people say dont quit SSRIs, listen to them
I was put on 20mg Lexapro through my university's health center, but summer rolled around and since I wasnt taking a physical class (online ones dont qualify you for student insurance apparently) I had to pay ~$400 for coverage in the summer in addition to actually paying for my prescriptions. I thought I was in a good enough place (not financially though, obviously) that I didnt even need Lexapro anymore so I started using my remaining bottle and taking smaller doses every day. I went from about 20mg to 5mg a day for a week or two and then I ran out. Fast forward to today (several weeks without) and I feel like i'm having a mental breakdown over every single thing, i'm a 22 year old man and have broken down crying multiple times in the past 2 weeks and have been getting increasingly angry and even violent in some cases. I was kept waiting too long in a lobby at my apartment for mail and I ended up telling the employees to go fuck themselves and ended up throwing a chair. This is all very interesting considering I got on this and xanax because i couldnt even order food wothout having a nervous breakdown. Another instance is when I stubbed my toe and proceeded to trash my entire fucking apartment and even took a machete to my fridge

Dont fucking quit cold turkey. I thought I could handle it but I definitely cant. I just hope this ends soon. I honestly feel like i'm losing it entirely",D

Hey guys this is my first post here and i dont know where else to go. Ive been in a dark place for a long time but im the kind of person who channels this into humor so not even my family could tell. I just turned 20 yesterday and ive been depressed for about 2 years now. I havent opened up to anyone about it because i keep brushing it aside thinking it would pass but it just keeps getting worse. Today i realized something that made me genuinely cry, i seriously didnt remember the last time i was myself. I used to be super carefree and relaxed, i was full of energy and would answer any call to chill in seconds. I just asked my close friend when was the last time he remembers the real me and he said it was the beginning of college and im currently finishing my second year. Its been getting progressively worse in the last 6 months with a serious drop in my appetite.  I also started feeling anxiety for the first time in my life and suicidal thoughts are uncommon Ive lost about 10 pounds in 2 months because of this. My grades also took a hard hit, going from a 3.0 gpa every semester to a 1.7. I just had a talk with my mom and she told me that im being ungrateful and that i need to get my shit together (ironic considering she suffered depression for years until i pushed her to divorce my father).  Im not blaming her at all for my situation because she was raised by two hardasses so i understand why its hard for her to understand why a teen would be depressed. I know that life is worth it and it gets better but i really cant keep the darkness out of my head. Weed has kept me sane for a while but quitting recently caused it to come back full force and i really need advice on how to get back on track.

342,"I hate myself, just a vent, going to delete
I don't even want anyone to read this. I guess all I ever wanted was for someone to want me around. The only way that's probably even possible is if I'm useful at anything. Problem is I am a grade A screw up. 

What am I even saying? I am incredibly short fused, I feel like I'm slowly burning alive. I'm just angry all the time. So people don't want me around, because frankly I'm an asshole. I hate who/what I am and violently hate myself. 

It's like I live in an abusive relationship with myself. I don't want to be this way, but I don't know what to do. I have been getting help, but it hasn't helped any. I'm just jaded, lonely, and it's getting harder to keep going on. I wish I could just go.

 I generally find television boring, have little to no interest in Netflix shows, anime, and most video games and hobbies. I really only have one hobby that I have feel attachment to,  and frankly, I dont enjoy most new shows. If I watch something of my own, its typically something I watched from when I was younger, like scooby doo or Phineas and ferb as the two main ones, being my absolute favorites from my youth, though that's rare as it is. And whenever I do those things, except for my one main hobby sometimes, I feel that I am all to aware that it's just escapism, and instead of escaping, I fall back into the same track. I don't  think I have a short attention span, but that's what I always feel like I go back to in the back of my head, as that's what people my age are supposed to have because of this digital age.",D

This more than anything reflects onto my own low self-worth, confidence and general view of modern day life. I really struggle seeing the positive in anything.

Everything to me basically comes down to: ""Meh, what's the point."" I don't like looking at myself in mirrors, by my own admission my personality is bland and empty and I can't really connect with people. I often wish for something bad to happen to me in my head.

345,"Does anyone else imagine their depression as being much more 'dramatic' than it actually is?
I always think of my depression as being something quite mysterious and I dramatise it in my own mind. It's as if my brain is just trying to make something of depression, which ultimately makes it worse because it gives part of my brain comfort in depression, as it least it gives me some kind of identity.

I imagine it as being this huge struggle with myself, almost like a character in a movie or a book and glorify the worst parts of it to provide myself with any comfort I can. It's pretty toxic but it's one of the only ways I can deal with it, does anyone else find themselves doing a similar thing?",D

Sleeping seems like the only way to keep myself from self-harming. I have bipolar 2 (heavy on depression, light on mania), so my depressive episodes always pass. I just feel like sleeping is the only way to stay safe until it does. 

My therapist uses medication as a last resort, so I’m not medicated. I should be, clearly, but she’s kind of a hippie. I’m not. If the drugs will keep me from wanting to or attempting to kill myself, then give me the fucking medication.

348,"I wish I could have done things differently
I graduated high school in June of 2015. Currently I am attending community college and have been doing fairly well so far although I don't know how long I can keep it up. Back in high school I didn't try as hard as I could have resulting in lower grades thus barring my chances of getting into a four year university. Freshmen year of high school I saw my lowest gpa ever I had gotten a 1.8 gpa in the 2nd semester of that year. Hell I was dumb enough in my freshman year to think that I could get away with cheating in my ceramics class but I ended up getting caught. If the university applications saw that I got a D in an art class they would have thought I was a full on retard for trying to apply to a university. It was because of my second semester of freshmen year that I thought my chances of a four year were impossible. I also never bothered to do the ACT/SAT because I thought that with my low gpa it wouldn't have mattered anyway. The following years in hs I've managed to improve a bit but not all that much. 




After high school ended I spent a year and a half not really knowing what I was doing taking a class at my community college here and there but not really committing, while also changing my major at least twice. If I play my cards right I'll be able to graduate by he end of May in 2019 and hopefully transfer to a university. But recently I can't help but think of how my life would have been if I had just went straight to a university after high school. I don't have any friends right now and I feel that if I had gone to university out of high school I would have had friends at this point. 




Right after high school I didn't really have any second thoughts and what I was doing. I was fine with going to community college and transferring later on but right now I can't help but feel that I've made a huge mistake. If only I had done better in freshmen year I probably would have gotten accepted into university and had a completely different life. I'm only 21 and I already feel like a huge goddamn retard for how I acted in my high school life. If i had taken things more seriously my life right now would have been a lot better. 




I feel like I have massively screwed myself. Most of the time now I think about what I could have done differently in high school and what my life would be like now. I honestly hate everything about myself and wish that I could just go back and make things right in high school. ",D

I dont have anything to live for anymore. 

I dont have any idea what to do with my life. I dont have any special talent or skills. The only hobby I really have is video games, but Im horrible at those. I've raged so hard at Battlefield that I broke down in tears and drooled everywhere, and anytime I play an RPG I restart so many times that it makes me not want to play anymore. 

All my friends have at least an idea of what they want to do, but I dont even have the beginnings of a clue as to what I want to do with the rest of my life. And to be honest, Im scared of becoming an adult. Managing a budget, doing taxes, paying bills, and shit like that. Im not fucking prepared for it. If I cant deal with the stress of a fucking video game, then I sure as hell cant deal with a job. 

My parents are also hounding me to get a girlfriend. I dont even have a friend who is a girl. All my close friends are male.

this is my first time posting on this subreddit but I need something to regurgitate everything that I’m feeling as it may be the only thing that stops me from trying to hurt myself. I’ve only slept for about 2 hours and I have to be up for work in 30 minutes which is making me feel worse. As my depression has gotten worse, I find myself sinking further into a place where I have no desire to help or look after myself. I still live at home with my parents and since my mom is aware of my attempts to hurt myself, she has taken on a lot of the responsibilities that I once had for myself. Like cooking for me, cleaning for me, taking me to work sometimes, sleeping in my bed with me. I feel so fucking bad about that, I feel bad for her and I feel bad that she’s really the only person. I have my boyfriend who has been as supportive as he can be, especially because he’s dealing with his own obstacles and  I feel like I’m incapable of being there for him. I keep having thoughts of breaking up with him and becoming so sensitive towards everything he says and it makes me beyond words angry at myself that I have failed him and our relationship. I can’t make me happy, I can’t make him happy and I won’t make anyone happy ever. I am attention and reassurance seeking, I get so angry at the successes of others because I’m not good enough. My identity is shattered and especially because now all I can think about is how sad I am. If I’m on this downward spiral now, will I ever get out of it?? If I have to live with this any longer, I really don’t want to live anymore. Everyday I entertain the idea of being in a car accident because I want people to take care of me and love me but I also hate that I want that and wish so badly to be okay with not needing validation and approval from others. I attempted to overdose recently and all I thought about was someone finding me dead on the floor and hoping they would feel bad. I couldn’t even think of how this would affect my poor mother who has been through so much with my ungrateful attenuation seeking ass. Im so grossed out with myself. I’m eating at myself and letting myself go, I keep picking and scratching and slapping myself because I don’t think I deserve to get better. I deserve to hurt because I’m a sad sack of shit who has NOTHING to be sad about. I have everything I could ever need in life and I’m still complaining like an ingrate. I fucking hate myself so much, there is someone out there who deserves my own life more than I do. I’m going to start antidepressants I was prescribed re cently and am in therapy (I don’t go as often as I probably should) and while that is good, I’m almost scared of getting better just to get worse again. I’m scared of going on antidepressants because I’d rather feel so much than feel nothing at all which is my predicament. If this doesn’t work, if I keep waking up depressed and if I continue to get worse, I really want to just die. I have no friends, they all live far away and I think they only care because I think they can tell I’m depressed based on some statuses I’ve posted. My boyfriend continues to be loving towards me, but I always feel like he only does now because he doesn’t want to hurt me. He says he wants me to get better and be more confident, and I can’t help but feel that maybe he deserves someone who is more confident. He reminisces on the past and is always talking about wanting to travel and I can’t help but feel so bad thinking that I won’t be involved in those plans because I’m not a fun person to be around. People have reassured me that I am more than enough but I’m not, I’m not I don’t believe them. They’re just saying that

I don't want to accept my poor mental health, and I don't want to take any of the medicine I'm given. I don't want to live with my parents.

I just hate the life I have. I feel like I'm in a terrible mindset. It's a mindset that doesn't let me grow, but makes me think I should try as hard as I can to.

358,"I hate it when bad people get rewarded
One of the facts that depresses me most about life is when bad people get rewarded and live comfortably, and loved by all.

It's hard for me to stomach. 

For example, I saw one of my former bullies enter the store I work at. She was absolutely terrible toward me when we were in high school, such as defacing my sketchbook, purposefully kicking my food away, sending me fake ""love letters"", and more. Anyway, the bully now had two children (I'm having trouble conceiving so that stings), and I think the bully could smell my fear because she headed right to my counter, and began to make a show of how expensive everything was in our store while also ""catching up"" by telling me about how successful she is with her self made interior design business.

When I got home that night, I looked her up on Facebook, and...she does have a much better life than mine. In every way. I feel angry that she seemed to have a great one while I've...struggled. ",D

363,"According to the mental health nurse i'm not depressed
So since october 2016 i've been (or at least thought I had) been depressed. I dropped out of school, started self harming and was put in hospital twice among other things. I spent nearly the whole of 2017 at home doing nothing because I simply couldn't. I got a full time job in september but I hated it and it made me worse and I had to quit after I started self harming again and have been cutting up until now (i'm 18 by the way if that's important).

Things have been getting worse again recently. I'm cutting almost every night and feel down and just cant do anything. I don't even have the energy to shower most days and just stay in bed until the late afternoon. However I was hopeful for today as I was going to see a new nurse who I was hoping would be able to set up a plan to help me. I was with the child services before and had an amazing nurse who helped me greatly but as i'm 18 i'm classed as an adult so have to go to the adult services. 

So as soon as I met the new nurse and we went into the room to talk she told me she knows almost nothing about me despite there being many notes from the past year. I told her about leaving my job and feeling low and the self harm and everything and what she basically told me is ''you aren't depressed''. She said that my self harm was normal as it was just scratches and I wasn't cutting deep enough to leave any scars which just completely confused me considered i'd been put in hospital partly for doing the same thing before. I've also suffered with terrible social anxiety all my life and find it very hard to communicate with others. I told her the only friends i've ever had was the friends I've made years ago when I first started going to school and what she said was it sounds like I have great social skills as i've been able to make friends. It honestly felt like she wasn't listening to a single word I was saying. As I said she had no notes from before and was basically just assuming what was wrong with me and that was it. Also I should add i'm in the UK so this is with the NHS so i'm not paying for this however my parents have said they would be willing to pay for some sessions with a therapist if that's was I need.

370,"I've lost 4 Marines to depression and almsost lost a 5th. None saw combat. I need help understanding.
Hi. 

I just had my 4th funeral in 7 years for yet another Marine. A few days ago another one called me with a gun to his head and i talked him down.

These 5 Marines, as far as i can tell suffer/suffered from depression. Pretty much every one of them was intelligent (like way too smart for the Marine Corps) and each of them stood out as ""the funny one"". To say very few people understood they were struggling would be an understatement. 

The Marine Corps has done a lot to try and help suicidal Marines, but all our training videos depict some ""clearly distressed"" person telegraphing an intent to harm themselves. In reality none of these people let on the depth of their suffering and only one made an attempt to seek help.

What I'm asking:

As someone who has never suffered depression (Ive been ""depressed"" but that was from external factors like a job not working out or a girl leaving me. I consider that normal human emotion), how do I identify Marines under my care thst may be suffering and need help.

They are NOT giving the outward signs in the stupid ""Lance Corporal Decker video"" we watch once a year.

Thanks.

Edit: been at work all day then went to visit a former Marine that dealt with some serious issues in his day but is doing well now. Mulled over a lot of this with him, then checked back in here and saw all these wonderful responses.

I have read every one, some several times. I have a lot to consider and learn, but thank you for helping me find some direction.

One thing i didn't mention is my role in all this. Im not sone big wig commander with tools at my disposal.  Im a newly promoted Sergeant and a squad leader with just a handful of guys under me. The one we just burried was not in my platoon, but i knew him enough to be deeply saddened by his loss. The other three were guys i was close to back in training, but i was not currently stationed with them when it happened. In fact i found out about all three of them on Facebook. 

This recent one, and the one that called me with suicidal thoughts, have made me want to be much more aware of the mental health of those around me. The scary thing to me is, even with hindsight, i wouldn't have picked these five guys out of the lot as having ANY kind of issues, let alone suicidal tendencies. 

I have also noticed, maybe because of my nature or leadership style, that im the one people tend come to with problems. I make it known that im here for that purpose, and people take me up on it. So I guess now i want to make sure i can spot when someone needs more help than they may be openly asking for. I will be more vigilant in my assessments of the needs of those under my watch.

Thank you all for the detailed and informed replies.

372,"My Mom shot herself.
Hi forum, I am going through alot right now and have no idea what to do. I will tell you the story, its a long one.. I hope you are willing to read.

I am 32 years old, I was very close to my mother.. We had a bond that was as strong as steel. My dad whom she was with since the age of 15 left her 11 years ago for another woman and found happiness. She had never been with any other man. I have an older sister that is 42 and we had different relationships. My mother was angry and could never get over my dad, year after year we would hear how much she hated him but still loved him, she would wish they could be one again. It never happened, she had been with no one and remained lonley for 11 years.
Her depression became her life, it was so bad we would stop talking to her because all she would talk about is killing herself and how she hated my dad. 10 years of it, She had little money and was very sick, She went from healthy to brittle in a matter of 10 years. Back surgery's, aching bones, depression, pain pain and more pain. It became up to me and my sister to take care of her, she couldn't drive so we always had to drive over to take her to the dr, groceries or to get things she needed, it became stressfull and we would somtimes bicker over it..even after the divorce my dad helped when he wanted to or could. 
She started thinking she was a burden.. then started lashing out on us at times, I went a whole year not speaking to her until she called me to apologize for her horrible words with me. I forgave her and we began a relationship again...this time it was amazing again, we got along and finally after 10 years she accepted my partner.
Long story short drama hit the fan again in early Nov this year. Things were said between her and my sister and they got me involved, I got upset with my mom and she was so hurt and thought that I thought she was a liar. My sister told me she said something about my son that she claimed she didn't. I didn't care after a while, I had plans with her on the day before thanksgiving to go see her.. on the 19th of NOV. She asked on the 19th if i could come hook up her VCR so she could watch A Christmas Story, I told her next weekend, then she later that night got upset again, she texted all of us the usual suicide talk. I had told her the day before that I didn't want anymore drama, if i went over with my family I didn't want to hear about my dad and sister. I just wanted to have a good time. She then texted me and a lot of other family that she loved me. that it wasn't my fault, she bought the gun... (I took her to get that gun for protection so I always told her if she did that I would feel to blame) She would say "" SON I bought it! Dont feel to blame"" I hated that! Still I never belived she would do it.. I was so bitter about her not wanting to be possitive I hadent called her. I ignored her suicide text and just decided to let her cool off.. 20th, 21st-29th we hadnt spoken.. I had a bad feeling but didnt know why.. she hadnt called.. so i figured she was angry with me.. I get a call from my aunt on my dads side who she was very close with.. ""Is it true? The rumors about your mom?"" I was picking up my kids from school.. I said ""huh? what she say about me this time hahaha?"" ""Call your sister"" she said.. I called and she told me to go home right away.. Then she said when getting home "" Mom... mom... *cries*... Moms dead.. she killed herself"" I said ""dont say that"" about 12 times breaking down more and more each time I repeated it.. I fell apart crying for who know how long... day one was hard, day two was harder, day 3 was numb and empty and I couldn't cry or sleep, day 4 I then hit a new horrible moment.. I found out she had been in her apartment dead since the 20th.. the complex lied and said no one heard anything and thats another story.. they are being sued soon.. her body was in there so long that we will not have an open casket this week in her funeral.. Then i went into her apartment to start gathering her things.. i smelled the death and decay.. I have never felt so sick and horrified in my life. I will never forget it.. i went to where she did it and saw the carpet cut out and her bed gone.. her place was left just like I last saw it.. it killed me..
I am now on day 6 and her ceremony is tomorrow in her home town.. Idk what to think or feel anymore.. my wife is trying to support me cause her mom died when she was 17 but i am changing.. She can see it, I dont want to run my company, I dont sleep, I have this numb feeling.. I cry out of no where.. I can not stop picturing her lifeless body, I cant stop thinking ""was she in pain?"" picturing her bleed out her exit wound for over a week.. I cry and can not stop.. I feel like dying.. I feel so empty and full of rage.. I wounder why she left me here..  I wish I could of took it back, I feel its my fault I should have went over or called.. My phone had got disconnected on the 19th but I had a home phone, she said ""I wish you could talk to me on the phone I love you""... I hate myself so much I hate myself!! I just can only think how I could have saved her.. I miss my mom.. I miss her so much! I dont feel I can cope.. Im sorry for your loss... im so sorry... welp.. shes in a better place.. STFU!!! Im so angry.. I wish I was a better person I wish I would of took her serious .. I can only listen to her voice mails ranting and raving how much she loves me.. I can read her text after all the times we hung out and had fun... I got my mom back after a year of not talking for only 2 and a half months... 2 and a half months of my mom loving my partner, getting along with me and having positive moments.. I regret everything.. please help me..",D
373,"Zoloft made me fly off the handle
I have episodes of clinical depression that last a few weeks alternating with episodes of being euphoric, having so much energy, and thinking I am the greatest person in the world and I have superpowers. It’s awesome but has issues of its own because I tend to make poor choices, act conceited/rude without realizing it, and sometimes get angry.

I was on Zoloft for a short time (age 11-12) and it made me a little less depressed but caused me to do horrible things impulsively, act spoiled and stuck up, and have frequent fits of rage. I attempted suicide within the first month of taking meds. I developed anorexia, made poor sexual and financial decisions, and was fired from my Saturday job as a babysitter because I was yelling at the kids, teaching them how to swear and bragging about it to other teachers, and trying to flirt with the children’s fathers. At school I told everyone I had superpowers and raged at them when they said that my superpowers were not real. I had arguments with my parents and pulled out a knife to threaten them at one point. I had a boyfriend but was still flirting with other boys constantly including my teachers.

385,"Beautifully Broken
I’ve spent most of my life afraid to be my true self because I believed that if I didn’t live up to the standards and norms that I grew up with, I wouldn’t be accepted. I was told since a young age how I should act, talk, and dress. I was told that money was important and that attending societal events and bullshit balls was your key to social success. And those things, trying to “feel” important, had meant everything to me.

But then life screws you over and suddenly your perspective on everything changes. I learned that I no longer wanted to be the person that everyone said I had to be and things that had once seemed important became trivial. I realized that I didn’t give a fuck if I had Tory Burch shoes or a Chanel bag. No amount of money could ever bring me happiness, which was clearly evident in the money that was spent on “I’m sorry” shopping trips and my therapist.

Things started falling apart at home when I was 15 years old. So my remedy to broken family was to drink until I couldn’t feel. But despite my new fond love of alcohol and its pain killing effects, I kept my life together. I worked hard in school, I stayed active in my community, and I made sure people thought I was keeping it together. I couldn’t let everyone know that I was a fucking mess. But in this process, I slowly lost myself and started living two different lives. When the curtains were wide open, people saw a girl that was very studious, had many accomplishment’s, and always had a smile on her face. But as soon as the curtains closed and I was alone, my demons came out. And the more I hid, the more I lost myself.

At one point, the alcohol wasn’t enough. Things had only gotten worse at home and I needed a new escape. The first time I did it, it was a pair of scissors. It was small, barely noticeable. I had sworn after the first time that I would never hurt myself again. But eventually I did, and when I left for college it had only gotten worse.

By my second year of college, I had reached my lowest point. I was in a toxic, emotionally abusive, relationship. I had a broken relationship with my parents, who spent most of their time stuck in a cycle of fighting, not speaking, and then pretending that they were okay. I hadn’t spoken to my older brother, a struggling addict at the time, in almost a year. I no longer knew who I was. So one night I went out and bought a bottle of wine with my fake ID and went back to my apartment and chugged the entire thing. I sat on my bathroom floor crying, staring at the knife in my hand. And in the back of my mind I thought about the gun that was a few feet away from me hidden in a book that my dad had given me for protection. For the first time in my life, I had looked at mortality straight in the face. I had questioned it many times, but it was never like that night. 
Eventually the crying stopped and the numbness came, a feeling I had become all too familiar with.

Would I do it?

Could I do it?

Would anyone care?

I was consumed with darkness, but there was a small flicker of light, of hope. I wanted to help people, I wanted to one day to change the world, or at the very least change one person’s life. I wasn’t ready to leave just yet, so I held on to the tiny amount of hope that was left in me. I called the cops and was admitted into a psychiatric center. I spent 48 hours in a white walled, emotionless, prison like place. And not once did someone ask me if I was okay.

My parents came up to see me and had a difficult time accepting what had happened and I didn’t understand why. They knew I wanted help, they saw the scars on my arms, and they knew that I wasn’t okay.

They blamed my relationship with my then boyfriend and told me to never speak of this to anyone. They didn’t want people to know I was “crazy”. Was I? During that time, I came to believe I was, but now I understand that I was just broken.

It’s been over three years since that happened and although I still struggled with a lot after that, I’m now in a better place.

The reason I am writing this is because I promised myself to one day help the 15-year-old me whose cries for help where tossed to the side, who was told she was over-dramatic and crazy, and who thought that cutting was the only way to cope. There was a reason I grew up surrounded by mental illness. I watched not only myself go through it, but I saw my brother, my parents, my friends, and so many people on the news struggling with their own demons. And this didn’t happen because life felt like fucking me over, it was just trying to show me what my reason for living is.

I spent years ashamed of the person I was because I was scared to show people my true, raw, fucked up self. But isn’t that the problem? When it comes to having a mental illness, we believe the stigmas that come attached to it and we’re afraid to speak up and talk about it. And the people who are lucky enough to not experience it, don’t want to talk about it either. The only difference from how mental illness was treated a hundred years ago and now, is that we no longer hide and chain our family members in basements or attics, but the shame and embarrassment is still there.

And I want to change that. I want to remove the stigmas and stereotypes attached to mental illness and get people talking. But change starts with me, and that means that I can’t be afraid to share my experiences.

This is who I am and I wouldn’t change my life for anything in the world because now I truly understand what it’s like to live with a mental illness. I finally know what the difference between sympathy and empathy is, and that is one of the greatest gifts that could have come out from this.

I will be exploring different topics on mental illness while trying to find ways to change the way people think and talk about it. I will not only be looking at the psychological background of mental illness, but the neurological background as well. More and more scientists are publishing articles on different alternative treatments that don’t involve medications. One of my favorite topics, which I will soon explore in more detail, is neuroplasticity, or the brains way of re-wiring itself to create new circuits, and essentially a new you.
I’ve set a goal to one day create a facility for those who are afflicted with a mental illness. But instead of white walls, cold stares from employees, and isolation, they will be surrounded by beautiful colors, the outdoors, and people who actually care.

Our current mental health system is completely and utterly fucked up. We can’t keep over-medicating people and throwing them out into the world with absolutely no regard for their actual well-being. If these “treatments” were actually working, we wouldn’t be seeing an alarmingly increasing rate of mental illness.

It’s time to re-define mental illness and stick a middle finger up to all the people who tell you that you’re crazy or different.

And maybe I am crazy, I’m sure as hell different, but that doesn’t make me any less of a person. I’m proud of who I have become and now I know what the purpose of my life is, and I’m not going to stop chasing it.

I try to be my own friend and spend time with myself but eventually it just makes me even more sad. I don't understand why I don't have friends. I've joined clubs and put myself out there and it just doesn't come together. How do I not let this bother me? How can I keep from being lonely when I am so, so alone?",D

Playing your favorite game? You shouldn't. Remember the time you shut yourself in just to play it endlessly? When nothing else mattered but your game?

Finished reading a cool book? Are you going to pick up another one and get sucked in again? Don't forget your friends.

Why would you hang out with your friends when they are tired of your negative attitude? Faking a positive attitude is worse. If you're going to be yourself just stay home.

Oh you got selected for a great job opportunity? Wait until they realize you're garbage at your job. 

You have time to relax now? Think again. There's always someone needing something or things that need to be done. 

Trying to treat yourself? Wait until you see the consequences from buying too many things or eating too much or wasting time.

You're actually being responsible and starting work early? Wait until you feel like nothing is worth it anymore. 

Why does it matter to do things you like if you're just going to feel bad anyways?

I've been conditioned to believe these things since I started college and I feel stuck. I'm trying to deny that I believe in these things, but the thoughts keep coming back.

Looking at my life from an objective point of view right now I have a lot of shit to do. I have no intentions on doing any of it though. I’ve stopped solely telling myself I want to die. I don’t know if I want to die. I don’t know if I want to be alive. I don’t even really care. I’m indifferent to both options. I feel like the only thing I do care about is what people think of me—which fuckin sucks not gonna lie. I take so much offense to someone not liking me in every way, yet I’m too fucking unmotivated and indifferent to make myself better. It just leads to a cycle of people disliking me&gt;me getting sad as shit and just losing a sense of caring&gt;me being a black hole of negativity which cycles right back to the beginning.

392,"Told my mother I tried to kill myself, she admitted she also tried when i was a baby.
I've been struggling with this  sickness for a while, it cost me my job, and a few friends, but only now i can publicly say that i tried to kill myself on the 19th of February. I tried to hang myself with a belt, fortunatelly i bought a really shitty one at primark and the only thing it did was leave me on the floor gasping desperatelly for air, filled with a sense of failure and a huge shame. I've always been an outgoing, funny, talkative and very active guy and i just felt as is i runned out of batery like something was leaving me without lifeforce.

After some therapy i decided to tell my mother about this. I went for a visit to my parents house and waited until we were alone to tell her basically what i've been writing above. Also told her that the biggest fear i had before doing it was that if i died my mother would also died just out of pure sadness. After we both cried for a while she dropped the bomb.

She had been struggling with depression all her life without me or my sister knowing about it and it came a point where she even tried of doing the same. The thing that stopped her was their children and what we would do with 12 and 8 years alone. She also told me that my grandfather didn't die of cancer, apparently he was an alcoholic, and when we where kids he threw himself at the well they had on the backyard.

All this just made me realize that people don't kill themselves, depression kills people the same way cancer does. People who haven't struggled with this can't even imagine what is living with depression and often blame a person who is basically ill.

 My mother also gave me the best advice i've ever recieved. She told me that I wasn't on this earth just to find a job and live the best way i could just by buying things, that it didn't matter if i didn't find a huge reason to live; just by being there i was already the reason for my mother and many others to live and be happy,  the same way she was for me. That even just by smiling at the guy at the supermarket i was already making him a bit happier even though it would only be a few seconds, and that should be enough.

I recently graduated high school with a decent amount of friends but have only really kept in touch with about 3 of them. I'm going to a college two hours away so the likelihood that I'll be able to even see those 3 people is kind of dwindling once I move. 

I used to deal with loneliness through friends on PlayStation but even those relationships feel like they're getting distant. I recently started talking to my former best friend from PS4 whom I've known for about 7 years but ever since he started seeing someone it feels like he's gotten meaner to me and doesn't care to be there for me in the same way anymore. 

I'm not sure if I'm depressed but I've never felt more alone or lost or confused in my life. I've managed to convince myself that I have no redeeming qualities and that my friends are only pretending to like me because they feel bad or somehow feel obligated to maintain a facade of friendship.

I didn't expect much reaction, since she doesn't seem to like spending time with me anyways, but a little more would have been nice. I guess I'm just bad at everything I touch.

Same with my other habits, I eat like once in a day, which is an obligation I have put on myself to do at least once. Even then its very less than what any normal person of my age eats. I barely get 4-6 hours of sleep due to my schedule and not able to sleep quickly at night.

**Maybe the only way to escape depression is gratitude.
Cicero, one of the senators of Rome in the early days of the empire is quoted to have said ""Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others.""


I liked waking up early and going to the gym on an intense pre workout.

I like stepping outside in the cold to smoke and feel the warmth when I re-enter the building.

I like seeing the trees trying to survive the winter, how splendorous they are. In them I see people going through hard times and the beauty that exists within them.

I liked logging on to Runescape to escape reality for a couple of hours and talking to my friends on there. The fact that we have escapes is an amazing thing.

I liked seeing three girls meet each other outside and say ""Hiiii how are youuuu?"" and compliment each other. Instead of normally being irritated by that, I actually admired that people in reality share bonds and happiness with each other's presence, and it made me happy to see that.

I like the complexity of the mathematics that I'm doing and the fact that I'm doing it.

I like having a planned meeting with a group of people today for my class presentation in college.

I like having a picture of a God who constantly forgives and is deeply saddened by our unhappiness that becomes to hard to bear for some, versus a picture of an angry Colonel with zero mercy.

Let me start by saying I've been getting help for chronic depression and anxiety since January. I take sertraline (50mg) every day, and it's helped me tremendously. 
I was hired as a cashier at a fast food job in November of last year, and it was a huge step forward. No education, no GED, no transportation, no job experience (except for working for a family company since I was a literal child); needless to say, I felt like I overcame a hump that had been looming in front of me for quite some time. 
I've had extreme social anxiety since my early teens, so diving headfirst into a cashier job seemed a bit counter-intuitive. Now, I don't know if it was the medication or simply having no choice but to face my fears every day, but the anxiety has completely faded. 
Gone. Zilch. 
Good, right? Well, in its place, a little seedling sprouted, and as time goes by it swells inside my heart and head, pushes against my skull, crushes my organs, my spark, my will to move forward.

so fucking much. 
I am so damn tired of hearing you complain that the price of a sandwich has increased by fifty fucking cents. I am so damn tired of cleaning up after your little brats after they throw their food on the floor. 
I am so fucking fed up with you cancelling an entire fucking order, after it was already prepared, because the soda machine was out of cherry Fanta. What the fuck is wrong with you?
I go home and utterly dread the next day of picking up the slack of my coworkers and dealing with a shitload of entitled, spoiled assholes. 
Every now and then, there is an angel. Someone who isn't a total asshole to me...it could be something so small to you, but it can make my entire day that much easier. Perhaps you already know what you want to order, and don't hold up a line of ten people because you're picky as fuck. Perhaps you tip me 96 cents. Usually, it's treating me like I'm a feeling, thinking human instead of the shit on your heel. 
I bend over backwards for these people and do my best to let them know that they're truly appreciated. 
I've come so far, and yet I'm so close to giving up. It's wearisome forcing a smile every day and powering through as if I have a promising future, when I don't. I pretend that I don't slice my thighs with razors, that I'm not covered in self harm scars, that all is well. I pretend I don't fantasize every day about diving headfirst in front of a semi truck. I pretend the love of my life and best friend isn't homeless and isn't living in a tent with a heroin addict. I pretend, I pretend, I pretend.

420,"I am too much of a coward to even kill myself
I am posting this here, not primarily to garner attention or sympathy, but because I have nowhere else to turn and I don't know what to do with myself. I also want to try and combat some of the embarrassment and shame that I feel in regards to being clinically address, so perhaps voicing what I am thinking here, it could potentially be therapeutic for me.

Now that is out of the way,this might get quite long, so I will put a tldr at the end of this.

Context:

I am a 20 year old girl. My whole life, my sense of worth was dictated around whether I could make the people around me happy. I had extremely strict and controlling parents and so I had no real sense of worth other than the fact that at least I didn't harbour any malicious feelings towards anyone, or try and hurt anybody deliberately. I had normal teenage 'angst' and moody, brooding periods, but absolutely not depression at all. I was completely, for want of a better word, normal.

In April 2017, I first had feelings of depression, when I realised how badly I had hurt someone who used to be very important in my life. (it is an extremely long story and I am slightly more at peace with it now so I don't feel the need to explain because it would take forever). I was incapicitated for a week, I would cry constantly, not leave my bed, and my mum would scream at me and tell me she 'didn't have time to deal with my shit'. However I had a REASON for feeling this down, so whether this was the start of a biological depression, I am not quite sure.

Fast forward to October 2017. This is where my current situation and problems begin. I am currently studying abroad in Japan- something I have been envisioning and looking forward to for 10 years. Honestly, I had been constantly dreaming about this for an extremely long time. It was what I felt my life was gearing towards, everything led to this.

However, it all went downhill. My host family is incredibly lovely, I had made a couple friends on social media before even joining the university, and there were so many intercultural exchange opportunities to join. Yet, despite this, I could feel my mood slipping gradually. I have always been a shy person and not good with strangers, but I began to feel a creeping anxiety looming up on me, that told me to not bother others, that by interacting with others I was causing them inconvenience and discomfort, and the best thing for me to do was to just be alone.

I partly attribute it to the fact I had a really awful teacher in my first semester here. Now, I think some people might think that this might be a cultural shock issue, but I am pretty sure that she was crossing ANY acceptable line, no matter what culture. Firstly she would be very rude to me in front of all my classmates. Say if I came in without makeup, in jeans (like, still showered, hair done, not sweatpants or anything, just not completely dolled up) she would say in front of everyone 'Your face isn't pretty enough to not wear any makeup. You are scaring everyone. You know girls in Japan care about their appearance. You should do too, for everyone's sake'. (Also my Japanese is perfectly adequate to understand interactions like that, so I know for a fact that this wasn't a language barrier issue. ) If I got a question wrong in class she would say 'You know, I don't know why I bother asking planyourspontaneity for answers, she is so useless'. Or if we had to make example sentences she would pick examples like 'What does planyourspontaneity need? Oh planyourspontaneity needs to learn how to make some friends'. And this became like a running joke in my class. I have never been bullied, so I never learnt to grow a thick skin, so this (what felt like) daily victimisation began to really grate and tear down my self esteem. I felt isolated so my social anxiety caused me to isolate myself, and people ignoring me, creating a vicious circle. I began to be completely mute in class, ignoring the teacher, be on my phone, having headphones in, and this obviously spurred her on as she would berate me for how I was a terrible student. Also I feel like it might be relevant to say how I told this teacher that the reason why I was so withdrawn and using my phone a lot was because my stepfather was undergoing cancer treatment and I was worried (this was true). But she still kept calling me useless and 'the worst student I have ever taught' to everyone. If I seemed withdrawn though she would stroke my thighs and lower back and neck (I think this contact thing might be a cultural difference but still) in front of everyone, which obviously made them think I was a total freak. If I made eye contact with them, they would quickly shuffle away or look disgusted.

Around November-ish time I began to suffer with very extreme bouts of depression. I felt awfully ashamed- here I was living the dream I had longed for for about a decade, and I was here for some reason feeling absolutely dreadful. Even if I had had a fun day, I still had this lingering sadness, and I would get home and cry. I started seeing a counsellor which was one of the best decisions (or rather, my long distance boyfriend decided for me) I ever made.

In December time it reached the point where I would barely go to class because the idea of seeing people, going to class, and even just getting out of my bed just seemed overwhelmingly difficult to me. I would cry all the time, tug my hair and cut my forearms, and would call the suicide hotline. My teacher emailed me numerous times, all very inappropriately about how her parents were dying to and how I should turn to God (not that I don't think that that is a viable avenue for some people, it just seemed like weird advice from my teacher) I tried going on anti depressants (Escitalopram?) but they made me vomit after just one pill so I stopped straight away. I travelled with my long distance boyfriend who came to Japan to see me, and felt nothing. Then I went to Nagano with my host family, and felt some kind of peace, and calmness. This calmness and general mellowness resided in me for some time, until now.

Current situation:

My depression came back with a vengeance yesterday during the day. At lunch time I locked myself into the bathrooms to cry and cry. I took a tranquilliser that had been prescribed for me during bouts of extreme depression to curb the urge to self harm and it did nothing. I hate myself so much. This exchange, this is what I wanted my life to lead up to, and my fucking brain is ruining it all for me. Aside from this, I had nothing to look forward to in my life. I just want to be happy, I want for people to not hate me. I know most people hate me because of the way they act around me, they won't invite me to any class activities even if I am right there, and I will be the only one not in the class group chat, class karaoke nights, etc etc. Literally the only one. I am scared of going to intercultural lounges to interact with people because they all know each other from last semester, and I can't even talk to people in real life in the first place. I just feel like an alien. I don't feel like I was meant to be born in this world at all. All I want is to be suddenly transported into a different world. I don't want to be here anymore. I just want to be asleep forever. I want to be dead.

But I am scared of death. I wish I was religious so I had some motivation for either killing myself and going to heaven, or for fear of hell having motivation and stay alive. What if it hurts? What if the nothingness is unbearable?

But I want to be dead. Every time I see a train go by I want to jump so badly. I know my boyfriend and family would be sad but they would get over it. He would get a better, non depressed girlfriend so he doesn’t have to deal with my shit anymore. My dad has a new daughter he treats better than he ever did me. My mum would be devastated but I don’t know if I can hold on just for her sake.

Anyway, I know I am not such a loss to the world. If anything, the vast majority of people in the world would be happy because they would not have to interact with me. I have nothing to offer anyone and my existence is just a waste and if I am not happy why should I even be here.

I wish I could gather up the courage to just do it and end it all but I am a coward and I am scared

423,"Why does it seem like everyone's irritated with me all the time?
It always feels like people want to get away from me. I feel like my personality make me way too annoying for people to want to be around, unless they have to in the workplace, to which they just get more and more irritated as the hours go by. This isn't just like being in a bad friend group, ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE I know has needed a break from me or told me to go away. Counselors who are getting paid to deal with me make me feel like I'm being too annoying. Maybe I'm talking over them too much or I'm too jittery. I feel like people are always trying to dominate me or shut me down.

No one has every seemed to seek me out or wanted to be around me. I'm the only person that enjoys my company and that's all I have. I talk to myself a lot. I make myself laugh a lot. This is occurring to me as I'm typing it and I feel like crying. I just want a person I can make laugh and inspire. I want to make a difference in someone else's life.",D
424,"I finally came out to my close friends that I have depression, and now I'm being alienated because I'm ""not mentally stable""
Probably a rant, but what the fuck.

This last college semester was horrible on me, and I came out of it with depression and depression meds. I'm 19M in college right now. I thought it was pretty obvious, but I wanted to tell my friends about why I've been talking less and have been hermitting myself out a little. So the next time we're all together, I tell them that I have depression and that's why I'm taking meds and that's why I've gotten so quiet, ect. And... Barely any response. Basically just some ""oh, ok..."" Like really? But it get's better.


So the night after I tell them, I get a message from one of my ""friends"", whom I was going to room with next year. The message said, and I can quote, that they ""don't feel safe around a mentally dark person"" in their house. Ok, what? Even better, the convo goes on and says that my group of friends were talking... And they don't want to, in quotes again, ""Associate with a mentally dark person"" as a friend. Like what the fuck? It's been a week and they've lived up to it. Suddenly I'm not getting invited anywhere or anything. If I'm with my friends (I still try to hang out), I'll get heavily ignored. Like what the fuck, my depression has now gotten so much worse.


I want to ditch every single one of them, but I honestly don't have any other close friends outside of this group. I'm trying my best to find new friends, and if that happens, I 'll happily leave these people who consider depression sufferers ""dark and unstable and unsafe"". Just needed to rant

I'm going to try hard to make new friends. **I WILL MAKE A PART 2 TO THIS IN MAYBE A WEEK OR TWO, JUST TO UPDATE WHAT IS HAPPENING BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE GONE/ARE GOING THROUGH THIS AND I WANT TO HELP THEM IF I CAN WITH MY CURRENT STUGGLE**

I'm finishing up my Masters degree and just feel hopeless right now. I hate school. I'm starting to hate my field of study too. I play the trumpet. But to be honest, I'm not very good at it. High notes, any other trumpet player will be able to understand. In the past two years, my playing has underwent some other terrible thing where I hesitate at the start of anything I play. It's 100 percent mental. I've made some strides in it, but it still comes back. For the past two years, it has made me feel like I can't even play a simple fucking melody to someone if asked. Trumpet is basically my adventure, but it seems like I just cause myself pain. I want to keep working on it, but boy it hurts my soul to suck and to keep not doing well. On top of that, I struggle with my weight. I love fast food. I know it's bad, but I use it to cope. I also would love to stop watching porn. I'm addicted to that. I've been addicted to that since I was probably in the 4th grade. I just feel trapped, like I don't have the self control or am not smart enough to discipline myself to fix these problems. I'm just sick of being a loser in life. Is there any hope?",D

I have 1 friend but I haven’t physically seen them in 7 years but we FaceTime and talk every single day until recently. No big deal I’m pretty used and expect people to drift out of my life. I know people who I used to be friends with but now we are just accquantences, we don’t talk at all but follow each other on social media. But here’s the thing, when you post things on social media about how you are ready to kill your self or how depressed you are and you don’t even get a text asking if you’re okay- does that mean no one cares? I see them caring about other people but they never seen to make sure if I’m okay. I mean I don’t expect them to, but I know when I see people that I care about talking like that I need to make sure that they’re okay. I mean, how can you say you’re friends with someone but not even say anything when they’re threatening to kill the selves. It’s weird, you’ll be Sauk g how much you want to die and how depressed you are and no one will say anything BUT they’ll make sure to send you a picture on Snapchat to keep the streak lol. Worthy enough for a number on Snapchat but not worthy enough to live in their eyes

Sorry for the rant, just wondering if anyone is expierencing this or idk. ",D
428,"I've never talked about this to anyone
I've struggled with depression since I was in 2nd grade. For the last 7 years it's gotten worst, I'm 20 at the moment. When I was 13 I was raped occasionally. Being raped when it first happen didn't bother me as much because I didnt understand what was happening until years later. What did bother me at the time was that I felt alone. I've always felt alone, never felt like anyone cared for me or about me. I fought with my mom and step dad a lot which made me feel even more lonely. I never talked about feeling lonely to anyone because I was always embarrassed about it and still do. Because me and my parents had a rocky relationship I would be abused by both at times. One time I was arguing with my mom and she ended up getting a 2 by 4 and started hitting me with it. I never rasied my hands at my parents, just talked a lot of shit and was an asshole to them. My parents kicked me out of their house when I was 14. I ended up living with my grandpa. This made me feel unwanted and even more lonely now that my parents gave up on me. I lived with my grandpa for about 9 months before he sent me back to my parents because he couldn't ""afford"" to keep me. I wasn't an asshole to my grandpa nor was I mean to him, I just was a teen who stayed up late and took long showers. My grandpa giving up on me was heartbreaking for me. I felt like no one wanted me and if I ended everything then everything would be better. I didn't even last a week at my parents house, they shipped me off to live with some family who lived in the rural country area instead of the city. I lived there for maybe 4 months and finished my freshmen year of high school there. I didn't feel welcomed anywhere I went and for the most part I felt more beyond alone. Majority of the time at my uncle's I was in my room, alone and desperate for a friend. After 4 lonely months of really being alone I was given back to my parents again. After coming home broken I learned to keep to myself. No one wanted me and no one cared. 

When I got back home I was sent to an all boy high school. Once again I had to go to a new school and try to fit in somehow. I was lonely for a while until I met this girl. I'm afraid to write her name incase she ever reads this and it hurts reading/writing it but I need to get this off my chest. I met this beautiful girl named Cindy at a school function. She went to the all girl school down a couple streets. Both all gender schools would make events for each other to get students that social interaction. Anyways I meet this beautiful girl named Cindy, she was nice to me and I was nice to her. We dated for over a year and while it lasted it was nice. The way she broke up with me literally broke me. I was having a really sad day and told her about how I struggle with really bad depression and that I have suicidal thoughts. Her response was ""oh"" and she slowly stopped talking to me. Eventually she stopped talking to me and when she did talk to me she made excuses about not having time to talk to me. She was my only friend, the only person I was close to. She couldn't be there for me when I needed her most, when I needed a friend most. So I stayed alone thinking maybe school was too much for her at the moment. Then one day I get on Facebook only to see her on it, I clicked on her page and saw that she had been on hanging out with friends and having the time of her life. She slowly broke me, I couldn't handle it and called her to confront her about it. She made excuses and talked about how she didnt have time for me at the moment, so she hung up and left it alone. I was reaching my breaking point, I was going to commit suicide. I sent her a text message talking about how I needed her to talk to me and be a friend because I was getting worst. She never responded to me however she did get in contact with my school to let them know what I was dealing with. 

I was so embarrassed that she did this to me, I felt betrayed and hurt that she made me the schools problem instead of hers. It hurt ne so bad. I was embarrassed that the school knew, I was embarrassed that my parents knew now. I wanted to kill myself more than ever now. I was so hurt by this and was angry at Cindy. I went home and tried stabbing myself. My mom went in my room to talk to me, just so happened at that moment I had a kitchen knife in my hand to stab myself. My mon fought me over it and sent me to a psychiatric hospital. I stayed there until December 23rd. At the hospital I tried killing myself twice. First time was when the guards/residents give you cracks, I ate the crackers but stuffed the wrapper down my throat. One if the residents heard me making choking nosies and came in to save me. Second time was when I started swallowing my food instead of chewing on it to choke me out again. They put me on these medications that didn't help but I acted like they did so I can go home. I was alone again, Cindy stopped talking to me. It broke my heart and broke me. 

It's been 4 years since Cindy and I'm not over it. It still kills me about what happened. I'm still depressed and suicidal. I honestly wish I did kill myself when I had the courage to do so. There hasn't been much for me other than pain. I haven't moved on and I haven't gotten over everything. This was my deepest darkest moment in my life so far. I wish I could say things got better for me since all of that but true is they haven't. I'm still the same lonely person I've always felt I've been for the longest time. I've tried dating in college and I've never had feelings for anyone. Don't have many friends and don't have any real reasons to be here still. I'm just waiting on that one thing to break me down to give me courage. 

If you read this thank you. Im sorry I made you read a lot and I'm sorry that I'm this way. I'll get better one day but not soon. ",D
429,"I'm not worth it
I just don't feel like I'm worth anyone's time or effort, and I just feel like a burden to everyone.
 I have a part time job (anywhere between 20-39 hours a week) and I'm at college (in the UK &amp; I'm 18)and I'm constantly tired. 
My mum is such a lovely person, but I really do feel like she'd be better off without me, she's always complaining how she never has time to do anything (she works 30 hours a week + she always cooks + cleans up after my stepdad and brother but complains about any mess I've made)  and I'm lazy, messy and I quite often ruin her day. But I'm sure I've ruined her whole life. 
She had me when she was 19, which meant she had to quit her job because she couldn't afford childcare and she had an abusive step-dad, who would refuse to let her mum look after me, and she also fell out with her very religious grandparents as she wasn't married (they have since made up). She then couldn't get a job until I started school (which is actually a decent job). At this new job, she met my step-dad (after a few years) and they've since had a child together (who also doesn't seem to like me one bit). My step dad seems to hate me more than my mum does, but I can't complain because neither of them are abusive, and this is one of my problems; I feel like I shouldn't moan about anything in my life; I live in a decent sized 3 bedroom house, I have an education and I also have a job. Whilst my mum lived with her abusive step-dad, was forced to quit college (so she could get a job to start paying rent) and was also forced to baby sit whilst her parents went out drinking every other night. Yet here I am, never feeling happy, without many friends (I talk to the people at work when I'm there and I have 2 other friends that I speak to around twice a month, normally because there other friends are busy and they want to complain about their boyfriends, or because the other friend doesn't want to go  shopping on her own ( another reason why I don't have a reason to be negative; she was in care and now classified as homeless as she's now 18 and not catered for in the care system, so now she has to live in temporary accommodation with lots of drug users in the same building.)

I feel like I just ruin everything, if I'm downstairs with my family, there always seems to be an argument, even if I'm not involved in the argument. But if everyone else is in the living room, whilst I'm upstairs in my own, I can only ever here them laughing and enjoying themselves. It's like, even when I haven't done anything, I seem to just produce a negative atmosphere.

I really don't want to be here anymore, if I disappeared, it wouldn't really effect any one, my mum might be upset at first but she'd quickly realise how much better her life is without me.
The problem is that I'm even too lazy and stupid to kill myself, so I'm just secretly hoping that a medical issue that has been ongoing for a while (and I haven't been to the doctor's in years because I would just be wasting their time, when they could be helping someone better than me) is serious, and nature will take its cause...",D

435,"Have you ever cried for missing your childhood so bad?
Well I often do, quite sometimes frankly. I just miss those good old days, when life was just so beautiful and easy. Nothing to worry about, nothing to cry for other than silly childish little things.

My childhood was so beautiful. It was in France. It's been now a whole decade since I left France - the country I've always admired and will always do. I remember going to school, having so many friends, I felt like I'm the happiest child on Earth.

Then suddenly one day, everything changed. The passing of time took away from me my childhood, my friends, my beloved France. Life suddenly just changed like that. No more joy, no more innocence, no more real friends, no more homeland. No more beautiful sunny days, only darkness, depression, nostalgia and tears.

I'm trying to survive day by day through this hell on Earth. Each time those memories of my childhood flashbacks, I can't help stopping the tears that drop from my eyes. Whenever someone mentions France, I get overwhelmed. 

I'm living the hardest time of my life. A 10-year ""war in lifetime"", as I call it, still going on, and doesn't seem to have an end soon. I know those good old times are just memories, obviously. Tomorrow when I wake up, things will be just the same. But my hope will never die. My redemption will come, soon or late. This moment of my life will also be just memories, just like those good old days of my childhood in France.

I didn't go in detail 'cause I don't think many people will be interested in my story. But if you are, I wouldn't mind sharing you the whole story, as long as you can share me yours.

440,"I want to share a personal project I'm proud of
A month ago I was feeling completely unmotivated to do anything. I was feeling that none of my connections with friends are as deep as they used to be, that I'm not as close to my family as I used to be, that nothing I do at work really matters, and that my health is slowly deteriorating. I just wanted to quit at everything.

Then I was hanging out with a friend I hadn't seen in a while, and he admitted to me that he had been struggling with depression, so we both opened up about it. He ended up recommending the book ""Feeling Good"" to me, since it had helped him improve a lot. I read it and was initially a bit disappointed... some parts were underwhelming, some felt annoying/condescending, and the solution to every problem seemed to be the ""three-column technique."" But after trying a few of the exercises in the book, I admit it turned out to be somewhat helpful.

One of the exercises/quizzes in the book is the ""Depression Checklist,"" which (as I'm sure many of you are aware of) assesses your level of depression on a scale from 1 to 100. At the time, I was scoring in the ""Moderate"" range. After a couple weeks of applying some of the exercises, I was down to the ""Mild"" range. So I decided to create a project that might help me learn a bit more about myself, with regard to the effect of my daily habits on my level of depression.

What I wanted to build was a simple web app that would let me score my productivity on a daily basis (based on exercising, reading, socializing, meditating, etc) and then plot that against my daily depression score. I wanted to see if there was a correlation between higher productivity and lower depression, or if certain activities had a greater impact on my mood.

Ironically what I discovered was that working on the project itself was a huge mood-booster for me, since it gave me a sense of purpose and was a great outlet for creativity. As I've gotten further along in the work, I've noticed my depression level has slowly started rising again. But for a while, I was actually in the ""Normal"" range of depressive emotions! I couldn't believe it.

Regardless, the project has also given me more insight into a few things that drastically help my mood. Even though my mood isn't at the level it was a couple weeks ago, it's nice to know that investing in personal projects gives me a lot of satisfaction :)

(Also if anyone is interested in trying out the app, feel free to check it out [here](https://beok.herokuapp.com/). It's stupid simple and still a work in progress, but I'm still kinda proud of it... and if it were able to help even just one other person, that would make me pretty happy &lt;3)",D

448,"Dropping by to mention you should take some Vitamin D supplements.
Of course, check with your doctor. Etc. etc. 

Vitamin D is the sunshine pill that most people are deficient in. This is also much more of an issue in colder areas or for those who cover up from the sun often. The best way to get vitamin D is through certain food combinations and routines in sitting in delicate morning sunlight and in most cases, taking a supplement is necessary to keep this vitamin flowing in your body. 

Vitamin D is best absorbed with calcium, so if you’re taking a supplement, finding foods, or sitting in the sun consider to add the calcium as well. 

You will find that your mood will be better or more stable with vitamin D consumption.

Make sure to strive for a more regulated sleeping schedule as well and something to keep your mind stimulated without an electronic screen.

Anyway, I just sat around with my pup and ate too much and watched tv so it is what it is.",D

haven't left my house since October and it's starting to take a toll on me. I'm paranoid as fuck and i'm starting to lose it. Sometimes I can't tell the difference between dreams and reality, I took my phone apart and threw the pieces everywhere so the only contact I've had with people has been on here since then. I want to gain the confidence to take my life and I think I'm on the right track.

I think the only reason i'm scared is because society tells you suicide is bad and my religious upbringing taught me that it's sinful. I don't care about any of that crap anymore, i don't care about anything or anyone",D

Cannabis and prescriptions weren't doing enough so I added gay sex with men to my regiment. I'm not even attracted to men. I just enjoy being sought after like a prize, and the way that these guys appreciate my body when I'm with them. Usually I just get massaged/played with for an hour and then give a bj in return. Feels amazing to have another human be all over me even though I can't ejaculate.

457,"Long Winded Post From a Failed 30 Year Old
I don't even necessarily want to write this but I need to clear my head. I've been a depressed pissant for as long as I could remember. Some of my youngest memories are melancholic and sickly devoid of confidence or even reason.

I grew up dirt poor. I remember spending a night pushing a needle through the rubber of my shoes to get the sole back on. My mom had a stroke and an aneurysm but survived. Sort of. She became a wicked, wicked creature who loved pitting me against my sibling and I never came out on top. My entire life has been from the cowering creature perspective. Life isn't experienced but something that happens to me.

I joined the Army at 18. I had gotten recklessly married a month prior to shipping to basic. I ended up fucking up and missing a bus which led to a Lemony Snicket series of Unfortunate Events type shit. I went through partial infantry brainwashing but never made it past the build-up.

So I ended my career, the only thing I've wanted to do, before it even took off. Luckily, it was more of a ""this isn't working so we'll forget it happened"" type deal and my enlistment ended without anything terrible. But I never recovered. At least back then I had some sort of tenacity. Now? I'm a fucking shell, mate, of what I was. A completely hollow individual.

I'm 30 years old. I've no education. I have no passions. I used to enjoy writing but I can't bring myself to write anymore. The moment I try I go back into wounded animal mode. No, this isn't good enough. Nope, neither is this. Why bother? Why try? I can't help but think these things.

I'm still married and that is the only reason I haven't killed myself. I did try early on because of relentless hounding from my father in law. It is obvious I'm not what he wanted for his daughter. I can't figure out why I'm alive at all. I can barely live my life.

I'm depressed constantly. No matter how happy I know I should be or how wide I smile I'm in the grey of storm clouds that seemed, at least until this subreddit, to be only over my head. I've had so many jobs that I just explosively quit. I've got Intermittent Explosive Disorder as well as depression and anxiety. So I coil up and wind tightly before my brain dumps chemicals that make me explode with no regard for the damage done. I'm currently unemployed. I left my last job like that. I loved my job. I loved the guy I worked for. I earned several raises within a few months and was promoted quickly because I threw my back into that work.

It has been too long though. I can't seem to find another job. I can't even bring myself to apply anymore. I don't have a car. I ""rent"" a couple rooms off the main house of my inlaws. I failed so hard in giving my wife a life worth living. She spends her time working and though understands and doesn't mind my unemployment it is killing me.

On Dec.12th I lost all interest in anything. I used to escape in video games but now I can't. I load up Ark and just stare. I've anxiety about everything. Recently installed Heroes of the Storm and I played a mean Lili and Abathaur but now I've got butterflies even playing against bots. The smallest, most simple of tasks seems beyond me.

I'm stupider than I used to be. How I interpret the simplest of sentences or instruction is out of whack. I have trouble reading though I've got tons of read Omnibuses from Warhammer 40k on my bookshelf. I have trouble speaking. I talk slowly and can barely push out the words off my tongue. I'm only recently able to make phonecalls without losing my mind anxiety wise.

I'm so full of regret. I hate what I became. I hate that I married someone and am dragging them through the mud. To never have a real apartment or car. I can't hold a job. I barely take care of the house. I do dishes now but it is a real struggle.

I've been thinking a lot more about suicide and I'm already sure I am too cowardly to really do it but I think about it a lot. How it'd hurt my wife but I think it'd be good for her to find someone else. I just don't see the point in continuing. I'm an adult now but I never learned how to properly be an adult.

I don't know what to do. There is a burning hole in my chest and I feel guilty that I'm the way that I am. Even on the subreddit. I know people feel that people who've a significant other can't be as depressed but I'm swimming at the bottom of the barrel.

I want this all to end. I don't know how to survive. I don't know how people manage it. I don't have that self-preservation sense that keeps people going despite it all. I'm weak. I am weak in ways that I can barely accept.

I struggle a lot with the fact 22 veterans a day kill themselves but I'm still around. I carry endless guilt that better people die and I'm still alive. Goddamn it. People are dying from diseases and cancers while I exist. While I can't so much as go outside without feeling like all eyes are boring holes into my psyche. I hate that all I do is sit here and lay in bed. I hate myself.

I feel if I don't get this out, even if it is never seen by anyone, I will implode. I'm on medication and it helped my depression but then the reality of my life struck me and I think I'm worse off than I was. At least then I was able to lose myself in video games. Now I'm here with the stark reality. I am not meant for this world. I am too sensitive, too weak, too weak-willed, and too much of a bitch to handle life. I'll go back to lurking now.

A majority of the time I’m just in a state of dissociation. It’s difficult for me to describe, but it’s like I’m just not mentally there. It’s like a constant state of autopilot. I’m there but my mind isn’t. My mind is always so foggy and difficult to navigate through. Most of the time, I’m just mentally empty.

460,"Why my relationship is killing me
Okay, disclaimer, former relationship... but it still has a huge effect on my life.

This girl was my best friend and my first serious relationship.
I met her when I first got depressed, and we went to the same church together.

I told her then that I didn't feel ready for a relationship, but she essentially stalked me all those (5) years ago.

Christmas 2016, after dealing with a crap load more grief and depression, I was essentially forced into a relationship with her.  I had just got over my main stint of depression the previous September, and my life was getting better.

We still hung out as friends, but she kept pushing for more.

However, she is so messed up.  I have to say that now.
I do still love her, and that will probably never change, but she needs professional help, and my mistake was thinking I could help her.  She was my best friend after all.

So, after a string of breakups, moving too slow and moving too fast, as well as her cheating on my several times, she finally called it quits one week after my birthday (November just gone).
I had no say, because she'd throw a tantrum, but I had to take the initiative.

Why?  Because she no longer wanted to have my baby.

In August, she fell pregnant.  This could have been the week prior the Anniversary of our first kiss, but the nurse dated it on that specific date.  That was one of the nights she cheated on me, with her friend's boyfriend, but it was ""just a kiss"".

She tried to miscarry by drinking heavily for the next few weeks before coming to me about it; she had broken up with me the day after she cheated.

I asked her there and then if she wanted to keep it.  She said yes.
We went to speak to my mum.  My mum asked her.  She said yes.
She wanted to announce the pregnancy, to start all the planning, and looking forward to the future.

I got a well paying job to provide for our future, a job I travelled hundreds of miles for each week, and it was only for a few months.

But whilst I was away, she decided she missed all the drinking, drugs, and sex she was missing out on.  She wanted to live with her friends (who she actually hates living with at times), and countless other reasons.

However, she kept stringing me along until the scan, where she sent me a photo of our child before telling me she wanted to abort it.  Oh, and I had planned a weekend away for us to relax and see some friends.

She had me believe this was the start of my happy ever after, before ripping it away from me.

She didn't speak to me for two weeks.

When I finally did manage to get in touch, it was to collect my stuff.  I took a mutual friend with me, the act as a buffer, and they couldn't believe the stuff that she said to me.

Then I get a load of hate off her because people are contacting her about her choices.
Remember, she has been posting on FB all about the baby, making sure everyone knows.

She hasn't spoken to me since.  She has blocked me anyway she can, even on WhatsApp only recently... not that it matters, because she wants nothing to do with me.

This was my best friend, and my stalker, who for years wanted to be with me, have a family with me, worried I wouldn't want her because of PCOS, and got jealous over people talking to me on Twitter, and kittens!  She couldn't even handle me showing up with chocolates and flowers!
All that I've done for her, supported her, sacrificed for her... and this is how she treats me.

Now, I am pro-life, and pro-choice.  I gave her that choice, and she wanted to go ahead.  I didn't force her or convince her.  She led me.
She set me up, just to rip out my heart.

Seriously, if you only knew the half of it.  The card she wrote for me for my birthday alone would have anyone convinced.

But now, she is living her life.  She is out drinking, smoking, doing drugs and sleeping with anything she can get her claws into.
She has restarted her YouTube ""career"", and quite frankly, they're boring videos.

Maybe she'll do better.  I hope not.  But I think that's normal.

So why this post?
Because it is killing me.  I don't know how, but I'm still kicking.  Depression is creeping at my door, and I do have horrible days, bad days where I am so demotivated.

Yet, I cannot stop thinking about her.  She has me broken, in ruins... even my faith has been hit hard.
I don't understand what changed.  I don't understand she did what she did.  Why did she play me for so long just to hurt me?

Everyone tells me to forget about her, and no one would allow me to go back to her (even if it was a possibility).

All I want to do is to forget about her, because as the title says... this relationship is killing me.",D
461,"Long text, I just want an audience.
Why haven’t I killed myself yet?

It’s not the title, but a question that lingers on the back of my head every second. It’s a common trend that people live for other people but what do you do when you have no one to live for? I never had anyone to live for. It’s not a huge problem really, its another lingering question or jealousy I have whenever I meet a person. Every single one of them have someone who cares for them, even a stranger would care for them. It makes me feel jealous that no one would care for me or even bother to be nice to me unless I open my mouth and say I have cancer or they knew about any of my situation. People don’t care, they pity me. They realize, then, that I’m a hopeless situation and they can’t help me at all because they really can’t. No one can.
Therapies don’t help. My therapist knows all of my situations are out of my control and he wants me to move forward with my life. It’s not really a bad idea, it’s the smart thing to do especially being someone in my situation. I just don’t know why I can’t. Every single being on the planet wants me to graduate already but my body doesn’t agree with me. It’s always either I’m too sad/ stressed/ depressed/ ashamed/ anxious/ lazy to go to school. Nothing helps. Not even the 30mg of Lexapro helps. My school counsellor is doing the nice “I get it, I understand” approach with me and it makes me feel better but it really does make me feel guilty.

I just don’t understand why are people act so shitty with me? Is it my face? Is it because no one cares and all I have is literally myself? Is it because I’m dying soon? What is it really? I just want to fucking die but I cant just let myself slash my throat or swallow a lot of pills because I’m a coward. I want the easy way out. Why isn’t cancer an instant death? Why aren’t suicide booths similar to futurama a thing? 

I give up. I just want to die. 

P.S. Fuck people who say they’re afraid of rejection because hunty what world do u fucking live in that not one single person has said no to you? 


P.P.S. Fuck you E, I’m sorry I disappointed you that I didn’t die yet even my diagnosis’ average life span is 6 months. Don’t worry, it’s coming. And I surely fucking hope karma is real. It’s fucking people like you who deserve such things and what do you fucking get? A nice family, a handsome face, people who likes to be around you. You’re one of the people who deserve my revenge and yet I’m being like a pussy who is letting a fake thing called “karma” take care of everything. In this fucking lifetime, not a single one got any karma. (or maybe my parents did by god giving me cancer but idk they just labelled me as a liability and now has dropped me like a hot potato so that’s really more on me than on them)

462,"I'm just so fucking lonely and I'm tired of pretending I'm fine
Fair warning I'm about to just spill out everything I have bottled up into this post

I'm so tired of being alone I can't bare it anymore. My depression and anxiety is slowly killing me. I'm a 23 year old male, trying to restart my adult life in college after many failed attempts at succeeding anywhere else. I work and I go to school, I see hundreds of smiling and happy faces, and I feel like I'm not even really there with them. Like a one way mirror where I see them but I'm never seen.

I have no friends. I used to be a part of rather large group of friends, but as of now I couldn't tell you the last time I talked to any of those people. They've either moved on and some of them are no longer on this earth. I have acquaintances with people at work, but they have their own life to live and when it's time to clock out, again I am left to go home alone and broken. The only person I ""have"" is my mother, and she tends to make matters worse when I try to open.

I'm also desperately single. I haven't been in a relationship, let alone just dated someone, in years. And it's soul crushing. I see all these happy couples around campus, beautiful men and women, having the time of their lives with each other. And I'm so fucking jealous man. I want that happiness so desperately bad. I want to love someone, I want to FEEL loved! I want someone to help me through days like today, and to be there for them when they have those days. I want the cheesy shit like cuddling and laughing over stupid stuff. I want the inevitable times where we're pissed at each other about something, but we work through it and end up going crawling up next to each other in bed at the end of the night, and wake up to see each other to start the day. I'm tired of waking up to this massive empty bed, cold and alone.

But most of all, I'm tired of pretending. Of having to pretend. To wear this mask every single fucking day of my life just to pretend to be normal. Just so my coworkers won't think I'm weird. Just so my mom won't go off about how I just need to get my shit together. Just so I can hold up the chance that one day I'll be able to overcome my massive wall of social anxiety and try to talk to someone, make a friend, maybe meet a girl. 

All in all I'm tired of pretending I'm happy, that I'm fine. BECAUSE IM NOT FUCKING FINE! I'm not happy, I'm slowly dying over here and I can't take this shit anymore. I desperately want to change. I desperately want to live a ""normal"" life, and I just keep sinking further and further down while everyone else passes me by.

The reason I'm now less likely to commit suicide is actually I won't / can't do this to my mother. We had to plan and pay for the funereal and oh my days it's expensive. Already we were on the line of poverty, and this didn't quite help.
I just can't do it to my mother to spend even more money that she doesn't really have. So now the feeling of guilt 'if' I were to do it is bigger than my misery.

Im 23 year old black man who just graduated from one of the best universities in the US. I've been depressed as fuck for a large portion of the last 4-6 years. I have no money, no girlfriend(or prospects), and no social life to speak of. I had a solid social life in college but had no luck with girls. Made a lot of friends but none that I'd consider great ones. I'm  afraid of public expression, if I come out of this shell I'll just be that little underdeveloped, short loser who thinks he's the shit when he's accomplished nothing in life. I'm afraid of what other people think of me, do they think I'm smart? Do they think I'm nerdy? Do they think I can't dance? Do they think I'm too short? Do they think I'm attractive? Do they think I'm gay? Do they think my voice is deep enough? Do they think I'm laid back? Do they think I'm fake? Do they think I'm a pussy? Do they think I get girls? Do they think my dick is small? Do they think I'm dressed well? Do they think I'm shy? Do they think I'm lame for a black guy? Do they think I act too white? Do they notice the awkwardness when I talk? Do they think I speak well? Do they think I ask too many questions? This causes me to lie to the people around me, including my family about little things that it's unnecessary to lie about. To put on this front of fake confidence when inside I feel like I'm not worth shit. I blow off my friends and then justify it to myself that I'm somehow too good for them. I don't pick up phone calls from family members and try to keep to myself. I just do nothing all day and wait for shit to come to me. I'm not the guy that gets girls, when it comes to trying to actually start a relationship with a girl my awkwardness and lameness just begins to show itself and she immediately senses it and can tell I'm not shit. I've had sex with 2 girls in my life and couldn't actually bust a nut for whatever reason. I'm an asshole to the people around me that do really nice things for me but somehow my brain keeps justifying my behavior and I keep doing it. I can't bring myself to do anything that is remotely productive or will help me better my life. I'm self aware to the point where I know I'm being a complete piece of shit but I can't find the motivation to turn it around. It's like my brain telling me I'll be content just living in my parents house until I'm fucking 60 years old. Somehow when I look in the mirror I see myself as an attractive man, I just look super young for 23, people say I look as young as 16 so I'm also self conscious about that which also makes me put on this facade when I'm around people. Recently for long stretches of months I just go completely ghost and don't leave the house or do anything of use. On the bright side I've had many positive experiences in life where I've felt my potential as a person start to become realized. I have a degree in communication studies from a top 15 university in the US. I have a family that loves and supports me (but probably wants me to move out just as much as I want to move out). This is all pretty incoherent and stream of consciousness but my brain is just really jumbled right now and I had to vent. I need to turn my fuckin life around.",D

It all went downhill from there. I feel like I’ve lost a part of myself. My personality, my identity, whatever. I feel like when I talk to others I’m not “there”, like I’ve lost control of what I say and think. Like I’ve lost my mind. Like others are normal and I’m in my own world, going through life on automatic mode, not knowing what I should think, say, or do. Even though from outside people might say I’m completely normal, even sometimes better than before, I feel like mentally, inside, the world is going down. My life is crumbling. Like piece by piece I get further away from a solution. Things that seem to work for others don’t work for me. 

I hate it. It’s not just a “bad mood” anymore. It’s feeling like I’ve lost my way, and there’s no signs to get back. Like a loop I can’t get out of. That’s why suicide comes up as an option.

Then, i meet this one girl , i had just left an relationship with another girl that end up with her cheating on me and well..i was even younger than now and i knew it how to fight, so..I beat the crap out of the guy and was disgusted by woman and by fighting like that again , i was so frustrated that i was traded by a 14 old boy (geez) but i overcome that. 
When i meet this girl (I'd call her Kim from now on) i was clear about all that situation and that i was not up for a relationship with her or anyone else.  
She was earning a place in my heart because Kim seems so different from other girls and was treating me well, she respected my hobbies, my dreams (it was 5 months to 18 years and i was going to join the military because IT WAS MY DREAM) and myself as a ''man''. 
So, she visited me, i visited her, we were 2 states of distance of each other, but ''never too far to our love don't reach each other'' bullshit (387 Miles) and of couse we started to dating and have sex, and all the vows of love, you guys know what i'm talking.. 

Then i was on my 18, i had finished a test if i was join the military as a seargent or if i was enter like a corporal and I WAS SUCEED \o/ . But on the other hands, Kim, that i had met 6 months ago was  through a rough part of her life, she had lost her job, she wasn't paying the bills and was about to get dumped from the house she was living (all alone) and then, i talked to my parents if i could help her by inviting her to come home with us, i was about to change my life, i was about to work twice as hard and so i did. 

I called her and say ''Hey, just sell your things, don't worry about it, we're gonna buy new ones baby'' Hell yea, like a fucking Alpha and she was so happy and she cried and she was all ''omg i love u so much'' Then i left all my trainings hobbies which gives me a lot of stress but i had back then a ''major reason '' for that and i was happy with her. 
Then Kim's past started to show up to us. A family of 5, me, my little brother, my mom and dad and now Kim. 
The thing is, Kim had a daughter that was with her aunts back then and she started to say she missed her, she was sad, she was feeling bad because she couldn't find a job yet (3 months had passed, it was a rough time on the Brazil enonomically speaking)but HEY, i had 2 jobs and i wouldn't give up, she was sad that i had to work so hard to : 
1- Help my parents 
2- ""Pay"" For her in the house. 
I was saving money too, because other than spending money with that 2  things i didn't have the time to do other things so some free time i had we would watch a movie, take some ice cream, have sex (a lot, geez) and that money that i was saving began to get bigger and bigger, till the point that i was thinking about buying some ground to maybe started to build our own house in the future when she get a job and started to help me . 
We would visit Kim's daughter from time to time and i start to love the girl, she was do damn smart but had a sadness in her that i could see, and one day in the house of Kim's Aunt, Her aunt came to me alone with Kim in the grocery store and started to say that i should stop my relationship with her. 
I was shocked by the comment, but cold as ice in the outside and just asked 'wth are u talking about ?"" then she started to say that Kim had beat her daughter so damn hard that almost killed her and that's why she was not with Kim anymore and she say Kim it's fckng crazy and all type of shit and i was pissed off. 

When we get back to home , i say to Kim what her aunt has spoken and she started to cry (and i was worried) and telled me a story (that isn't even worth bring it here for u guys) that in fact was another person who beat her daughter. 

Well, time had passed, we didn't talked about it anymore and we were hanging out and she turns to me and say ""What about we did a lil shot ? "" (That is the equivalent on Brazilian to ""LET'S SMELL COCAINE)i was ""What ?"" and she ""Yea, it will be fun, i will let you do it in my sexy belly if you want"" . It's unbelievable how someone so damn pretty and hot and smart and intelligent and perfect could turn into a fucking piece of shit so god damn fast. 
I refuse the ''offer'' and started to yell at her and started to talk some monstruous shit about it, like ""it was because of that you daughter almost died ?"" and everything, i was pissed off, sayed some shits that i shouldn't , she say it too but we overcome it. 

So, i was with Kim about 2 years by now AND THEN SHE FINALLY GETS A JOB. we had moved on from my parents house a long time ago but i was not happy because Kim's past started to bother me. 

In that time i discovery somethings new about her (with 100% sure before you ask) : 
1- She did sex for money , even when she knew me and just talked to me back then. 
2- Her ex was a asshole that was aprisioned . 
3- She lied as fuck to me about almost everything, her life, her family (like ""my dad is dead"" type of lie), her past, her path. 

But this is past RIGHT ? right ? maybe i should just 'fuck off' and get back to my parents house but love is a sick joke. 
Let's advance some months (10), we had a baby. She is the reason that i'm here typing this now for you guys read it, because if not, it was for me being burned in hell for suicide. 

She of couse, hid the pregnancy , tried to abort EVEN WITH ME BEING BY HER SIDE, lied to me about birth control pills yea, but fuck it i was a man and i for sure wouldn't let my daughter be aborted , she then tried to give her for adoption and was all about ""she will trouble us, our life"" and i was about to kick her out from the house get my baby and that's it. My parents started to help me but the damage was made it already and it was about to get worst. 
She was my bride and guess what ? Yea, she cheat on me. 
I understand that sometimes i was a dick but man i was not up to be a cuck. I went crazy again, but i controled myself, i send her back to her state with 2 K of money from my own (she quited her job with 2 months of pregnancy ) . I was so god damned hurt. Cheat on me with my best friend cliché ? Wow. Then i started to think about it, he had a great body because he almost live in the gym because he didn't work and didn't have a family . But she doing that ? That hurt me a lot more than he doing it. And i was only 20 back there. She find another guy, and seems like I 'm now the aprisioned guy addicted to drugs (like her aunt had telled me ) you know ? I'm so fucking sad. I loved this girl so fucking much , i wish so fucking much to had a life with her, with her daughter, with my daughter. She left and didn't even ask about our daughter. You know how sad this is ? 
On the other hand, i'm so frustrated about womans and so sad that every girl that i start to like i dump her because i don't want to delay her life like KIm did to me. 
I'm fucking scared of relationships, i'm fucking scared of girls , i'm fucking terrified by the idea of trust anyone else then my father and my mother. i 'm not feeling like a man anymore, i'm feeling like shit. BUT i started to train again in Muay Thai and i'm enjoying it. but i feel so fucking lone because i really do everything alone. My workout, go eat some pizza, walk in a park.. i'm so alone. 

Well, i stopped to take drugs to feel better , i stopped with almost everything and started to go to gym and for now that is working, i'm just hope that someday in the future maybe.. Kim would become a nice person and will try to retake all the time that she is losting.

Not even sure if I should post in this sub, but..  


To the people who *used to* suffer from depression, from trauma, from anxiety, from whatever made you miserable, I'm not you.   
  
You were once miserable, like me, you saw no light at the end of the tunnel, but then, you didn't give up. *Something* happened. Now you're happier, now you've got your happy ending, now you've got people who love you for who you are. But I'm not you.   
  
You probably changed, you probably were capable of change, were strong enough to change yourself even. I'm not you.  
  
I've been gone for a long time, now. There is nobody here but bad habits and terrible feelings. Sometimes I feel a semblance of someone who just wanted to make other people happy and be loved, but I think the misery just piled on like miles of permafrost.   
  
I can't blame people for not loving me, but I do blame them for lying to me. Don't they know it hurts more to say 'I care' when they don't, and it takes me much too long to figure it out? How am I ever supposed to trust people when they say they care if it's been such a common lie? The worst part is, *nobody can prove it, because nobody can help me, because nobody knows how or wants to*, I don't know. I've been asking for help for a long time now but nobody takes me seriously.  
  
You, who says that I shouldn't give up. Why? I'm not you. Years from now I will *not* be surrounded by people who love me, I will *not* be anywhere closer to happiness, I will *not* find anyone who loves me. If that person exists, and perhaps they do, I will *not* ever have the luck to meet them.   
  
You tell me I have to love myself before anyone else will. Those who grow in complete solitude don't even learn a human language. So tell me, if there is nobody to show me how to, how do you expect me to teach myself to love myself? I think you just want to place the blame on me. I don't 'love' myself and so that's why I am miserable. Not because of depression, not because of isolation, not because of poverty, not because of heartbreak, it's because I don't love myself in a world that's only taught me to hate and criticize myself. In this world where the people I thought I could perhaps give my heart to, say 'I care about you' and then show me those words are meaningless.  
  
Forgive me for being skeptical about getting better when I've only seen my life decline since it began. I'm not even asking for pity, because I know it's just the luck of the draw and I was dealt a particularly shitty hand. But can you please understand that not all of us are going to be okay in the end? Just because you suffered for many years and I've suffered for many years and you no longer suffer like you used to, doesn't mean I'm not going to continue suffering as I always have been.

485,"Is it possible to fake depression?
I have been feeling bad for about 7 months now.
There are periods where I cry on a daily basis, I never feel like talking, I struggle concentrating and collecting thoughts, I feel such an extreme sadness inside of me also in happy situations, I am exhausted all the time even if I sleep 10 hours straight, I often have headaches, I am completely alone and I find it difficult to do anything.
There are nights where it’s unbearable. I think about my situation: I am completely alone, I am failing at anything because I am so weak I can’t handle my feelings, I feel guilt for everything that happens around me, I can’t carry on anymore, I am always here in this dark place and I feel that I have no right to be like this. I used to self harm and I still have many scars on my skin, but I think to be disrespectful to those who truly struggle then I promised to cut never again. I shouldn’t have the right to do so.
My life is void, I am void, and I can’t get the energy to do anything ever. I do not get pleasure from what I used to love, nothing seems to make me feel something good. I can enjoy no series, no book, no videogame like I used to.
I think I don’t even deserve to eat.
I am just trying to pity myself giving myself depression, but I don’t have it.

Hi everyone, my GF of 2 years has been on antidepressants for about 15 months, there is a definite lack of sex drive since then, but I understand that can be a side affect and she's acknowledged it and we've spoke about it. But sex itself is not really the issue. 
There is a distinct lack of affection. We never make out. Or really kiss unless I initiate it. Or hug much. It makes me feel shitty and lonely when I'm consistently the one pulling her in for a hug etc. I've spoken to her about it and she gets defensive and says she gives me plenty of affection and makes it seem like I've got a problem.

491,"My SO has panic disorder and it’s making me depressed.
My SO has been diagnosed for now with panic disorder (waiting on health monitor results to check to see if it’s not something else)

The last couple of months have been really hard. He has overtime gotten more worried about his health and every time is convinced that it’s cancer or something else deadly. 

He can spend hours on google about a discomfort he feels and freaks out because webmd says it one thing and another site says something else. He checks his heart rate every 15 minutes because he downloaded an app on his phone. 

I have taken him to the er multiple times in the past couple of months and each time they say that’s nothing is wrong he’s just having bad panic attacks. He won’t believe them because then he’ll go on reddit and see stories of people being misdiagnosed. I’m convinced he’s a hypochondriac.

We can’t go about one day without him saying he doesn’t feel good. It’s hard to enjoy myself whenever we go out because I’m just waiting for him to say something about not feeling good so we can just leave wherever we’re at.

I don’t know how to fully support him through this.  When he freaks out and wants to call the ambulance I don’t know if I should let him knowing that they’re just gonna say he’s fine or tell him that it’s in his head and make him feel like I’m not taking him seriously.

She tried to rediagonse my depression as a narcissistic personality disorder. There's a laundry list of things that have been said to me. It's making me feel useless and sad and reinforcing the notion that no matter how hard I try I will never be good enough, that maybe I deserve to be alone, etc.

I feel like I'm going to have to either let her continue to talk to me like this or stand up for myself and lose her as a friend. While the latter option gives me the peace of mind to think it's not me, that I had enough self worth to stand up for myself and not cave to my friends abusive reinforcement, I really don't want to lose her as a friend.

I just graduated high school and all throughout high school I have struggled with depression and anxiety. At my school, there was this really cute girl who I had a crush on. She was in two of my classes and I got know her pretty well. Although she was kind of out of my league and I could tell she wasn't into me romantically, I never minded just being her friend because she's really sweet and mature compared to most other people at my school. It made me really happy to spend time with her and made my day so much better at school even if it was just walking in the hall for a few minutes. Most of my mental health issues came from school related things and when I was with her I would totally forget about all that stuff. Unfortunately, sometime towards the end of the school year, she started dating another guy and after that she didn't really seem interested in being my friend. Now it's summer and I've tried to keep in touch with her. I send her snapchats sometimes but she usually leaves me on open. I hate seeing pictures of them together.

I don’t really give a fuck anymore that people might be upset that I’d commit suicide. I definitely don’t give a fuck when people get worried when I say that I’m gonna do it eventually. It is what is. I’m not happy, I never will be. When I tell my therapist that I’ll never be happy he asks me if I can predict the future. Obviously I fucking can’t but if the last 15 years have been any indication of what my happiness is gonna be then it ain’t gonna get any better

With all of that said, and here I go contradicting myself, but all of what I’ve just previously wrote scares the absolute shit out of me. I’m terrified that I’m starting to give less of a fuck.

I also bought green contact lenses to wear, and even sunbathe. I invested so much time (and money) to improve myself and look amazing and no. one. noticed.! I look at the mirror and I am happy with my results. Then, the moment I exit my house:BOOM. 4 months thrown into the trash. No one cares. It makes no difference.  The women I'm attracted still do not find me attractive. It pisses me off how I imagine they won't survive just one week of my training. They can't see how hard I worked to change. I downloaded Tinder,even saw my EX there, wrote a BIO describing myself (I still find myself interesting. People, don't) and I got nearly 0 matches.
Now I'm stuck in an Alcohol /Cigarette/Party/OneNightStandGirls loop and I can't get out of it. I drink so much that I can't even remember some things. I have fun, yes. But I want to have a connection with someone again. Is it asking too much? Why people don't give a chance to know me??? ",D

So I am going to bed after posting thus so sorry if I don't respond right away.

I am 32. My short and sweet backstory is that I lost the love of my life because of alcoholism and depression. The way we broke up was the worst thing to happen to any person. She basically called the police on her way home from work, had me put in jail for a week on false charges and since I moved out of the state I couldn't call my family while I was incarcerated and charges eventually dropped. It broke me so terribly that I literally split personalities. 

I have the me that stares deep into the darkness all the time and the me that deals with and tries to make sense of the aftermath. Every time that person takes over I feel a part of me being lost. In a way it us insanely scary that depression can eventually turn into this.

Thanks for reading.",D
507,"How are you? I am not okay.
I’m in a kind of adverse situation, my thoughts are all over the place and I really don’t know how to break this cycle.
Basically what happened was that a few days ago, I sent my best friend a message before school, saying that I wouldn’t attend classes because I wasn’t feeling too well, that I felt like giving up and that, in case I also wouldn’t have been at school the following day, I had probably killed myself. I wasn’t joking. Sometimes I get these sort of “impulses”, most likely caused by me being overwhelmed by my emotions, my thoughts, and as a result of that, it feels as though I lose my common sense, my ability to think rationally. My thought patterns become unpredictable, but so far I’ve managed to not act on them, or else I wouldn’t be writing this right now. Currently they’ve been happening a lot more frequently than usual and that seriously freaks me out because during those times death seems like such a good solution to my problems.
So, back to the story. Obviously, my friend got really concerned and encouraged me to come to her place because she’d been staying at home that day. BUT she also contacted my mom, which I didn’t know until hours later, and told her that I wasn’t at school and made a concerning remark, but I don’t know exactly.
My mom started to call me like every minute and I started to panic because I thought a teacher had called her, so I didn’t pick up any of her calls. I spent the rest of the day with my friend, but called my mom in the afternoon. She asked my where I was and it sounded like she was crying and I told her that I was at my friends place, but after that she declined the call. That night I slept at my dads place, my mom called him and told him that she didn’t care anymore about what I was doing and that kind of hit me. It was the last thing I wanted to hear in that situation. I just don’t know what to do. I really do feel miserable. My friend is beating herself up because she thinks it’s all her fault and I don’t know, I just feel bad for feeling bad, if you know what I mean. That message was a cry of help in a kind of way and I don’t understand why my mom reacted the way she did. It just makes me think that maybe everyone is really better off without me.
I’ve been depressed for nearly five years now, but my mom never really paid attention to it and just marked me down as lazy. I’ve been doing great for a good six months in 2017, but then somebody really important to me, somebody that kept me going, passed away in December and since then everything had taken a turn for the worse.
Life has become so hard for me, I’m sleeping the days away because I can’t bear the thoughts, the guilt, because I’m too much of a coward to face reality. I’m trying, I really am, but no matter what I do, this feeling, this feeling that eradicates my will to live, remains.",D

510,"I want to share my experience moving to NYC from Israel - four months ago
Hello everyone,    
I just thought it would do good for me to share my experience moving to this city among other new yorkers and maybe hearing some new voices of people who are living here and know better than me or even went through the same thing.    

So basically, I'm 28 years old and moved to NYC four months ago with my wife. My wife is doing her Ph.D. at Columbia University, and I just joined her (with a work permit during our stay here), and we are going to be here for at least 3.5 years, but we could choose to stay for five years if we wish to. (At the moment I don't see it happening)    

I have to say that moving here has been the most difficult challenge I've ever been through in my life. First, though my English is not bad at all, I'm SO, SO insecure about it. I'm feeling afraid to open my mouth and say complicated things, and it is depressing me. (I am a person who's talking a lot by nature. I've always been like that) And I feel like someone took away that ability from me and I'm much less charismatic in English than in Hebrew which affects my confidence tremendously... After smoking weed for 4-5 years almost every day in Israel, I quit doing it since the first month I got here only because it made me feel very anxious (it used to make me feel quite the opposite before)    

I used to be a teacher in Israel and pretty quickly I've found a job as a teacher that teaches Hebrew here in New York. (In Israel I used to teach History which I found much more interesting than teaching a language, but that's what I got here, so I have to live with that) A few days ago, I had a conversation with my boss, and apparently, they are pleased by my work there, and they asked me if I am willing to continue for next year which is nice to hear even though I don't like this job that much. I guess I will have to compromise.     

My wife and I are supported by an excellent scholarship, and we don't have to worry a lot about money or health insurance so, on the financial field, we are kinda covered. But being here makes me feel powerless. Obviously, I don't have my good friends here with me, and I feel much less ""special"" as a person. I feel like I am only one among millions who are trying to survive in this big hectic city. In the beginning, I thought it is beautiful that this city is full of people from all around the world, but now it just feels to me that everyone are strangers to each other and it seems like it is the loneliest city in the world at the moment.     

And because I don't have friends here and I am married (so meeting with girls on tinder etc. is not an option) I don't have many reasons to leave the house and it is kinda sad. The only reasons I'm leaving my house is for yoga classes, work, and restaurants with my wife. Other than that I don't have any other reasons to leave the house... The weather is fucking horrible, and it is so cold it is painful to me being outside.     

Anyways, I don't expect from you guys to be my therapist or giving me some life-changing advices... I guess I post this to release some steam. So if you managed to read my post until the end, Thank you :) And I hope things will improve for me. I've always lived in Israel and only left for trips. The longest was 3-4 months, and I have never relocated my life to anywhere else. So maybe it is just a matter of time until I will start to feel more like home here. If you have anything to share from your experience, that would be lovely just to know that I am not the only one who is going through this adjustment period.     

Thanks again for reading and for your patience. Have a great week everyone",D
511,"Depressed? Or Just in a Bad Rut? (Long Post)
I've never really felt like I've had depression before. I'm turning 24 at the end of the week, and this is the first time I've honestly wondered about myself. Usually, I'm pretty happy about things, and my outlook on life has always been realistically positive. But, lately, I just feel absolutely lost. And this morning, after I got off of work, I sat and cried. I'm not much of crier at all, and the only other time I've cried in the last ten years has been at an uncle's funeral recently. 

This past summer, for me, was a pretty great time. I was in a relationship with a girl who really made me happy, more than any other one had before. I seemed to be having fun every weekend, whether with her or with some friends of mine or family. I had a lot on the horizon, and a lot to look forward to. I was getting ready to finish up my degree, and it seemed like things were going in the right direction. The only thing that was a problem then was that my job was a third shift job, but it was 3 days a week, and usually 11-13 hour shifts, meaning I had time to do stuff outside of it. But, my then girlfriend and another friend had solid connections that they thought could help me land a much better job where they worked, which would carry me pretty well until I finished school. Things were looking up for me. I was pretty happy. 

I guess things started to slip for me when my uncle got hit with a terminal diagnosis in August. At 47, and with young children, nobody in the family was prepared to lose him. And the disease, an incredibly rare degenerative brain disease, was the same one that killed my grandmother 11 years ago. We lost him in early September. The thing with this disease that nobody in the family is talking about is that, if it hits twice within the same bloodline, there's a 50% chance that living relatives within the bloodline will get it in their 40's or 50's. There's nine of us left in the immediate family, including my mother, my brother and myself. And since it's so rare, there is absolutely no treatment plan. 

That, for me, was a lot to process. I'm not worried about myself, but the idea that I could still be losing relatives to this disease for years sucks. It's hard enough seeing it happen twice. 

During this time, things started to fall apart with me and my then-girlfriend as well. I kind of hid out with her for a while, because my family was perpetually sad and in a state of distress. And since I worked nights, I was kind of isolated. Things started to hit a rut between me and her when she started her own treatment for depression. I tried to be supportive of her, while doing whatever anyone in my family needed while my uncle was sick. She really seemed happy that I was there for her, (and things really worked out since she lived so close to my uncle anyways, and I could bounce back and forth from place to place on my days off.)

Both my family and my girlfriend were very important to me, and I guess helping them out made me feel good about myself, even though the situation was shitty. I kind of let school fall to the back-burner though. And I kind of neglected my other friends for a while as well. But between work, my family, and her, I was consistently busy. 

My uncle passed in early September, sending most of my family into a pretty bad state, and only a week later, my girlfriend decided she was done with me, because she was afraid that if she recovered from her depression with me around, then she'd equate me with happiness, and if I left her then she wouldn't be able to recover. (Which ended up being mostly a made up way of saying, I don't love you anymore, but I don't have the courage to tell you.) Obviously, it wasn't fair to her to be stuck with me if she wasn't happy with me, but there were so many better opportunities for her to break things off, and she chose the one that was the most tedious and mentally draining for me. My state of mind after it ended wasn't great at all, and I said some very mean things to her after it ended, (I guess, at the time, I thought it was constructive criticism, but it was all just mean and awful and embarrassing.) Understandably, she hasn't talked to me since, and I feel like I burned any bridge towards reconciling with her.

I missed my uncle a lot, but doing favors for his wife and kids helped me at least feel like I was contributing. My mother's still kind of a mess about it, but she has my father for support. My brother had a hard time for a while too, but his job keeps him well occupied. But, lately, for me, the things I can help with anymore have been fewer and fewer. 

Right now, I just want to fast forward to like March or April. I don't want to deal with my birthday, since the plans I had with my ex-girlfriend are obviously not happening anymore, most of my friends are busy with work and school, and my family is still not back to being normal. Nobody seems to want to do much for my birthday anyways, which is, for lack of a better word, normal for me. When I got home from work this morning, I cried thinking about it all. I've never had that kind of emotional reaction to anything before. 

The only thing I look forward to in life at the moment is my night or two out with a friend a week. The holidays are going to be rough on my family, I know now that my ex girlfriend (who I still care for and would probably take back) has completely moved on from me, and the once promising prospect of a new job isn't nearly as likely as it used to be. And, school kind of got caught up in the shuffle, and I'm not where I wanted to be with that, either. I'm going to be out on my own come January, which might help, but right now I'm just dreading the next month. I feel like the things I care about are slipping further and further out of my control, and it's hard for me to deal with.

I don't know if this is just a rough patch in my life, or a sign that I have a more serious problem. But right now, I have very few people that I can be 100% open with, and it's been tough. Work is, for lack of a better word, quiet for me, meaning I spend most of my time thinking, and it doesn't help much. Since I've never really had a stretch like this before where I've been as mentally drained and just sad, I'm not really sure what to do. But there's very little on the horizon that I'm looking forward to, and I'm worried about that. 

tl;dr: Stretch of life events, most of which out of my control, have wreaked havoc on my emotional state. I now feel kind of hopeless. Don't know if it's just a rough patch in life, or something worse.

512,"Embarrassing myself at volleyball tryouts
I'm a freshman in high school and we just did volleyball tryouts and they were fucking horrible. I had to wake up at 5:30 to go to them because they started at 6. Literally everyone there was better than me. I fucking hate everything. I'm such a failure. Like everyone was doing actual spikes and sets and shit and I was just there. They probably thought I was in special ed. At least if I had a mental disability I would have an excuse to be so shit at volleyball. I'm probably gonna quit tbh. I've never wanted to die more in my life. And I know you're probably gonna say do your best and I am but my best isn't good enough. This is what I get for trying to be less depressed using a sport. I don't even look like I'm in high school,I'm just a short 5'0 Indian kid",D

514,"Unrequited Love Crept Back Up to Haunt Me
First off, I felt the need to create this fake reddit account so that my posts could not be linked to my actual reddit account, and I could vent to reddit without worrying that any of my family or friends will read this.

Unrequited love is the worst. It consumes your mind almost every second of every day. 

I'm usually a positive person (at least I try to be). Grew up with this girl in the church. We were the best of friends. In high school, we went to homecoming and senior ball together. I asked her out 3 times, once in middle school, once in freshman year, and once in senior year, all three times given the response ""I'm sorry, I don't like you in that way.""

It messed me up. Even affected my first two relationships. I got with my first girlfriend solely because she liked me. Part of me hoped my best friend would get jealous. I genuinely liked my second girlfriend and she liked me. This girl gave me the butterflies, but because neither of us made a real effort to be boyfriend and girlfriend, we didn't last. Before, after, and sometimes during each of these relationships, I would wish it was my best friend (I know, a dick move). 

Then I messed up. I was influenced by a terrible person to say some things I shouldn't have. We went to the same community college like we planned but three years passed without ever seeing each other because we were fighting.

The time that we spent apart allowed me to clear my head. Before, I used to think about her all the time. Now, days, even weeks would pass without her crossing my mind. I met plenty of people in college and made tons of good friends, focused on my hobbies, it was the happiest I've been. 

Eventually, we got tired of fighting and I realized what it was that I fucked up: an extremely good friendship. After I made an effort to show how sorry I was, she made an effort to let me back into her life. Then I thought, ""Don't fuck this up. She doesn't need you to like her. She needs you to be a good friend."" I said some harsh things, and because of it, we weren't friends for 2 to 3 years. So naturally, we tried making up for the time we had lost. 

She invited me to hang with her friends. I invited her to hang with mine. We would do things together, play music together, video games together, and just genuinely hang out. We talked things over and settled our fight by blaming that terrible person that we both dislike from before.

We eventually went to the same university together and some of her closest friends became great friends of mine. We took a class together. Would exercise together. And we've gotten to the level of ""No judgment"" as she calls it, where I've told her some of my deepest, darkest secrets, and she did the same with me. 

Problem is, as we spend each week almost always hanging out 3 or 4 days out of the week. I find it harder to come to terms with us never being together. She's never dated, but she tells me about guys she's liked, little things that happened to her like small romantic contact like ""holding hands"". She has A LOT of guy friends that she's close with, and a few girl friends that she's really close with. And though it only bothered a little back then, it's something I'm jealous of now. Each time I see her, I first think to myself ""be normal, be funny, don't show any signs that you may still have feelings"" and it works.

I'm happy with the way things are, us spending lots of time together, hanging out at each other's houses for hours, trying different foods, and just having someone like her I can talk to. 

But thinking about the guy she who will eventually be her first boyfriend, or her husband whom she may have kids with, that future where another guy becomes the guy she sings with, dances with, goes to church with, does romantic stuff with just pains me to think about. 

Well, it's late (like 3 in the morning) and this is the time when I'm usually in my feelings. If you've invested time to reading my story this far, I thank you and would like to know what you think about my situation. I'm a bit dramatic, and I overthink like a muthafucka, but I'm an honest fellow, and this is first time venting to reddit. And it's a bit ironic, cuz I should get some sleep since she's coming over tomorrow. 

P.S. I thought about solutions like slowly drifting apart from her, but I've come to the realization that I would rather have her in my life as a friend than not at all. But it still hurts. ",D
515,"Even hate eating
I can’t even eat anymore everything tastes like shit to me don’t like doing anything don’t want to go anywhere don’t trust anyone hate being alone but it’s the only way I know to stay away from all the BS.  What’s the point of living such a meaningless worthless life???? 

Also I think I’m losing my mind I catch myself doing weird things and sit there like wtf did i just do that for 

And sometimes if I am walking late at night  I sometimes think hopefully someone comes up and shoots me or stabs me and this nightmare will be over ",D
516,"Nothing.
I just don't want to do anything. Nothing is the only thing that ever sounds good anymore. The stuff I study in school is really cool, but when I get home I just want to lay down and do nothing. Smoking weed makes it easier but I know I'm just pushing my feelings away.

I'm just... Tired. And I feel like a bitch because of it. I go to school, work on some homework, go to work, procrastinate homework to get some damn relaxation time, rinse, repeat.

I wish I could stop working and just focus on school, cuz it genuinely makes me happy as long as I can dedicate the time to it. But after working I just wanna do nothing. And if I work less hours I just get stressed about paying rent.

I don't know if I hate myself or this economy more, but I just wish I could go far away sometimes. Just leave everyone behind and find somewhere to sit and do nothing. Listen to a waterfall crash in the forest, or just look up at a sky that isn't polluted to hell with light.

517,"I've always resented my mom for being emotionally abusive growing up and blamed her for my depression. But I just told her I'm depressed and she responded in the most perfect way. I feel really weird.
I'm an adult now (24) and have had crippling depression since childhood. Growing up, I never had emotional support or love. I was called names and my mom took out her relationship/life issues on me. I was distant from both my parents. I've hugged my mom only once in my life. This is just one issue out of many that led to me developing a fragile self esteem and crippling depression.
Over the years, with distance, we started to talk- like once a month or so. The more educated I became, the more I came to understand why she acted the way she did (although I still harbor much resentment)
I'm going through a depressive episode just now. I feel so alone and I texted her out of desperation. I told her I felt alone and depressed and couldn't get out of bed to study. Instead of judging me or saying something mean....she just listened to everything and all of my symptoms. She said that she felt so sorry for me and she wished she could help me. And she told me to never feel alone because she loves me and I'm very important to her. She asked if she could do anything to help me...and I realized, yeah, if we could call each other every morning, I could have someone to talk to and tell her about my daily goals. Then I could feel more motivated to get out of bed and feel less alone that day.
I just feel weird, because I don't have a relationship with her. I'm scared it's going to be awkward, but I'm desperate for any support I can get right now. I also still resent her, but at the same time understand. I don't know. It's just weird. 
But, I'm happy she acted this way, for sure.

521,"I think you guys might understand this.
I was walking with a close friend after having lunch together, and I told her, ""I feel as if I'm living on borrowed time.""

She asked me to explain further, but I couldn't find the words to better express that perspective.

She then proceeded to recount to me all of the myriad ways she's nearly died on some of the trips she's taken.

I confessed that I couldn't really relate to those sorts of situations or how they've affected her, as she has more zeal for life than anyone I've ever met.

Whatever she was describing about perceived proximity to death didn't suit me.

Then the words came to me.

I feel as if I'm living on borrowed time, because I feel like I could, at any moment, lose what little will to live I have left.

It's like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. I see it in slow-motion, slowly falling to the cold pavement, but I don't know when it will finally make contact.

In the meantime, I'm existing, trying to experience new things and connect to people as much as I am able to, but I can't shake the conviction that I'll eventually resolve to leave by my own hand, despite whatever life I've made for myself.

The fight's already been lost, and at some point, I'll have to accept defeat.

So I'm gonna make this self deprivating post quick. I was a sick child. Shit was fucked. Too young to understand what was going on and had lots of surgeries and what not. I possibly have autism, I was diagnosed with sensory processing disorder to get O.T. however I think they gave me that so I wasn't stuck with the label of autism. I think they believed I was too young to be diagnosed and so I never got a checkup from a psychiatrist after O.T. . So it's possible I'm autistic but idk. Anyway my childhood was shit. Absolute fucking garbage. I was the loser kid. Had physical issues so I never left the house. I was ugly and fat. My entire childhood was just a big fucking waste of time. Anyway I become 16 and start hanging around bad kids. At this point I lost all fucks to give about my schooling. My social skills were finally developed enough so I can make friends but I didn't really like any of them. I started getting a prescription for drugs. It wasn't very difficult given my medical history. Started taking Adderall daily. And my mom would occasionally give me some Xanax she had. Also started drinking. I guess some warning signs for a shitty life but idk. I'm not entirely sure what to do at this point. I plan on going to community college since I'm probably gonna drop out of HS soon. I just don't think I'm ready for the real world. I always feel like I'm that one person who just can't adapt to things.",D
