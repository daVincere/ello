0," Who else loves the rain?, i know I do. And today it rained all day.  I got a chance to walk around barefoot in the woods in the rain.  I am at peace... However, tomorrow I have to get a brain scan... That ought to be a blast! nnnnnnnnnnnnnnoooooooooooooootttttttttttttt. Last time I did that they made me hold my breath whenever the scanner went over me.  And the tube was really cold, yecch.  I hope all goes well, I really would rather not hear that I need some sort of surgery.  But if I do have surgery there is a pro, I get HOSPITAL SOCKS!!!!  Those are so nice, they have the little sticky pads on the bottom, and they are ever so warm.  The con of the situation is having to wear a gown.  I always imagined having to wear one, and waking up after anesthesia with a face drawn on my butt secretly, damn doctors..... I'm off te finish me book. g'night

5," Hey Levi thanks for helping me figure this whole thing out, mad props bud!   This is how I feel You don't know me, so dont talk about me! I know what happened, I was there and you weren't! He is saying that I keep calling and bugging him, but I'm not. You didn't here the things that he said to me and you don't know the way he made me feel. He was my good friend, He could tell me anything, problems with his girlfriend or school, I could also tell him anything, I thought that I could trust him. I was wrong. He told you lies so that way he could be cool and I would be a fool. So this is how I feel. Right now I'm not thinking about what we could have had, Because you are not worth it. Why would I want someone who tells lies? Why would I want someone that can't respect me? You might ask why I am saying all of this if I think your not worth it, But the truth is I don't know either,  I guess that's just how I feel! -Chelsea

8," Yes my first entry! I really like to do this a long time ago when I found out to one of my friends this blogspot thing.... Its cool!! No need to write... If you guys don't know yet, one of my past time is writing to my diary, I have 3 notebooks filled with stuff regarding my life and it is nice to share what’s going on with my life to my friends. I hope you can visit this page everytime. Just to let you know who I really am, and what kind of person I am (its the same thing right!) haha... So everyday I will write my high time and low time... Right now my HIGH TIME: Singing again! It’s been a long time, I love to sing and I’m going to look for a way to join the choir again. That is my passion, but do not ask me to sing in public because it's not my thing to memorize lyrics of the song, but if you will request beforehand I can sing it for you... I also sing in weddings and funerals (joke!), so if you guys need a wedding singer just give me a ring! DOWN TIME: I wasn't able to sleep well I do not know why,,, maybe because there is a lot of things going on with my mind, my work, friends and family... work because I don't know yet if I will resign or not.... it's a question and you know how hard it is to look for a high paying job so I'm still thinking it over and over and over again!!! I just hope I will find an answer this week... Friends yes I love all my friends but I miss some of them specially my PREX family, we don't have time to bond anymore because of my schedule, I really miss them and I will try to make it up to you guys! My family, yes because there is a lot of things I want to do with our house I want to buy things, but of course I need money to buy it,,,, maybe one by one I can buy things for them... specially T.V. I want to buy my mom a TV for her room so that she will be able to watch even if she is in her room.... Anyway I’m sleepy now so till next time I hope I will have time tom. To write…

9," Church was so much fun last night especially when we had the banana and orange eating contest.  You might be asking why it was so much fun, well the reason why is because you could only use one hand to eat both of them and I beat 4 other people!   Levi, Jessi, Joni, AJ, and everyone else knows how fun that was.  After church I went to one of bestest friends house, we ended up staying up until like 5 in the morning!  We ate Burger King for dinner and had Taco Bell at like 2am.  When we got to the window at Taco Bell we could not stop laughing, I wonder if the guy thought we were high (Levi knows what I'm like at 2am lol).  That's about all that we did.   Hey Sarah!  It was so good to see you at church, since I haven't seen you your graduation party.  Next time that I talk to you I will tell you who the peom is about.   Sorry that I don't have any more wonderful writings for you, Sarah and Levi, but I will try and write something later, so that way you will really know how I feel!  Love ya! ~Chel'C

10," Dear Friendship Troubles,     Give your friend the weekend to calm down, and you should too. Think of what you might have said wrong to her. On Monday, try and talk to her again. Don't talk to her and bother too much. If she tells you to leave her alone, leave her alone. But just say to her, I understand that you are mad at me, but I really think you should listen to what I have to say. Then, if she lets you, explian to her that you are sorry, and you don't like not talking to her. If she doesn't let you explain, resort to the next step. Write her a note. Write down everything you would say to her if you were talking face to face. Tell her to write back, or talk to you. It might just take one appology, but if it doesn't don't keep bothering her. If she doesn't talk to you for more than a month, maybe this friendship wasn't meant to be. If you have any more problems, don't be afraid to tell me about them.

11," This is my new blog.. i have closed my old one due to personal reasons... but never mind about the past.. the last few weeks was hell for me.. i lost my best friend to my enemy,  i screwed up my client's case, my clients are still haunted by the lawyers to pay her legal fees, i spent my entire week trying to please my big client for documents, karen left me for japan, boyfriend was bus at work, bad mood, dint do as well last quater,...I am dying for a get away!....This week is better... i went JB shopping with yann... went dinner with karen last nite... missed her quite badly while she was at japan... We had our usual dinner at bishan..Junction8 is a dangerous place.. with charles and keith and their ever changing new collections, g2000 with their storewide sale.... and new players like seiyu.. which comes with loads of in house brands .. i saw this black shift dress.. so nice... only 33 leh.. even karen told me to buy it.. NO NO.. karen is a bad influence..heh.. i saved her from buying a cutie shoe from charles and keith.. i guess karen and i gonna be soul mates for a long time.. i lost my best friend and her best friend is at australia. so we can take care of each other untill clara returns.. and i got to return her to clara... actually i am glad that i lost pris at this time, she is seeing someone she likes, whom i disapproved as 'he' is not a christian, and i tink that they will not be happy together.. pris is always haunted by the bag idea that she shouldnt be going out with non christian... at least she has someone to hang on to if she is really depressed... and she has that group of girls to cheer her up... i feel that maby pris thinks that i am very shallow to give up our friendship.. but i have went alot to make a decision like this... i came a conclusion that i went through all her unhappy moments with her, and she shared her weekend with another group of people... many of her words sided them.. i decided.. that this friendship had to go... hiya... i hope i can get over this fast... ok.. better not talk too much about unhappy stuff.. its friday!... better finish up with my work so i can meet my darling tonight!!!

12," let the anonymity begin.  i think we all have something we want to talk about, but that we can't quite bring ourselves to reveal to anyone we actually have to see face to face. i have an overwhelming feeling (regardless of its veracity) that no one will quite understand what i'm saying. but if you do, please share any insights you have with me. my views are not extreme or disturbing, just a challenge for me.  let's start with the introductions. i'm a 27-year old single female. this is NOT a solicitation for men to start asking me out. it's simply a fact. i love being single and being able to do whatever i desire with my life. i've recently returned to grad school and changed my career/life path extraordinarly. i've also moved to a new city where i have made some great friends (mostly male, as is the norm for me). i come from a christian household and still cling to my faith despite doubts and challenges. the big challenge currently is sex.  for better or for worse, i have a sex drive. currently, it's driving me mad. but i also have a moral code that keeps me from even entertaining the idea of casual sex. due to my odd combination of faith and life interests (drinking, smoking, crude jokes, liberal hippie crap, independent lifestyle, tolerance, tattoos, piercings, etc.) it is very difficult to find anyone who is compatable with me. and that's the beginning of the trouble...when i do someone who looks good on paper, i cannot get interested (even though i desparately need to release some pent-up sexual energy). i'm not looking for a solution, per se, but i am frustrated and venting. what am i looking for? HOPE.  so if you got it, send it my way. are you a christian man or woman who has found a great sexual and life partner despite not ""appearing"" to be the christian norm? i often consider giving in to a casual encounter, but i honestly don't think i could physically go through with it...and i'd certainly beat myself up afterward. not out of guilt, necessarily, but just cuz i know that's not what makes me happy.  life is good in so many ways, and hopefully through more of the posts i can open up more of who I am to myself (and to anyone who cares to read them). i am a very odd combination. and i like it :) but i think most people find me very confusing (probably think i'm a prude)...and they like it from about 10 feet away. goodnight moon.

14," im kind of new to this blogging thing so what im gonna probabally do is explain what i do on a day o day basis. before i go on i do gotta tell you that i am in high school and may not spell things correctley or use proper english and sometimes thethings i may tell you about may sound kind of childish but the people i hang out with are open like this.  to start ou i wanna tell u  about this girl i like, im not gonna tell u her name but lets call her ms.n, about all year i have been seeing her in the hall but couldnt like ask her out or anything cuz i was with someone, so when i finally broke up with her i was like, hey now i can talk to her, so u know i started by saying wazzup or how are u doing. im kind of a shy guy and dont really talk to that many girls, not that im gay or n e thing, but im shy, so i told a couple of my friends and they like the loosers they are went and told her before i could, not that i was in a rush to tell her and all but they were like she was like she was flattered and all but that was it.  so my friend was like go up to her and talk to her so i was like ok i got it all planned out im a go up to her and be like ""wazzup u know i like u and all cuz i know all these people been tellin you and i wanted to know if i could get your numer and mabey i could call u some times"" so i had practiced it in front of the mirror and had it down pat and ready to do it.  so i went up to her and did it and do u beleive that she said no , well not so brief and short and blunt, but she was like, i dont really give my number out to that many people, so i was like thats cool so i left it at that.

17," Ever been bogging?  Put on a pair of old sneakers, clothing you don't mind getting wet and lets go for a walk.  As you step out onto the bog it is like stepping out onto a waterbed made of moss.  Your feet sink into the ground as water fills in the whole. It is a creepy but wild experience.  If you dare you can walk right out till you are waste high or go over your head.  Now you may ask what does this have to do with a Blog?  Absoultely nothing but being as much of an environmental science nut as I am, it was the first thing that jumped into my mind...  So feel free to bog around!  Enjoy!!

18," Yup, today was just 'one of those days'.  Everyone has them, they are inevitable, along with many other things in life.  I woke up late, and isn't it funny, it seems that most days when u start them off bad by sleeping in when you shouldn't, they just go downhill from there.  It's true, observe your day next time you wake up late...  but it wasn't the small annoyances that made my day 'one of those days'... these small things such as being late for work, the kids being off, tripping over EVERYTHING, breaking my cell phone (on one of the trips ), and losing my keys just made the bigger things in my life... much BIGGER today... As I look on my life right now, it seems like utter chaos, and I don't like it.  I am trying to be strong, but lately I just don't know.  How do you gracefully walk away from someone you love no matter how right you KNOW it is, especially when you are sending them straight into the arms of someone else?? Between this, and many other things going on, I , for the first time in my life, feel completely lost.  And I spend a lot of time trying not to feel sorry for myself, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  I don't know how people can deal with so much WORSE, and it happens. Daily and in tragic ways.  So,this pattern of thinking does put things in perspective b/c my life isn't exactly tragic, but my sentimental side tends to still succeed in getting in the way.  Anyway let's just say that after today, I hope I wake up one time tomorrow, so it's not another ""one of those days"" :)

20," Howdy everyone,     I guess I have to find a way to write in this a bit more and keep things up to date however that is somthing I am not always good about. Now that summer is here maybe if there is any exciting news I will post some info and see what is going on in my life.    So now that school is done and I have one course down and I have been to Burlington and back I now enter July.  THe month of unchartered waters. Who knows what this month will bring for me.  I am sure I will have many adventures but at the same time I am sure I will be busy with all the free time I have to deal with.  Today I finished one of my first summer craft projects. I redid my fun chair.  Oh it was so much fun and now I have a very nice light green sponge painted chair.  I think I should just go into home decorating and photography.  I guess maybe if nothing else I will use this as a gauge of what I get done this summer.  Well I hope to get my puzzel I got started and done. I am working on ideas for my classroom. I get to work on bulletin board and decorating ideas. Oh the fun that is present in a summer off.    The 4th of July is here.. I think back to the two times I have not been in the US to celebrate the 4th. One year I was in Paris France at the Hard Rock Cafe and then 2nd time was this last year when I went to Australia for the Summer.  The 4th was the last day we spent in Port Douglass. We went out to Hog's Breath Cafe and had a blast with the bus driver.  OH the memories of July 4th past.  I also recall the year I went to my friends house and we had a hudge water fight and I got water dumped over my head.. Yeah many memories and I am sure more to be created yet this year.  Till next time keep on blogging and Happy 4th!  Cheers!

21," Well hello there... I know I'm being stupid to switch blogging sites, but I stumbled across this in my journey through the good ol' informsation superhighway today, and it looked pretty cool. (Don't bother pointing out that it doesn't have any more features that livejournal.com :-P I like the way this one *looks*, so nerrr). Still at TAFE... procrastinating... With you-know-who sitting next to me again. I'm already that close to strangling him. How am I meant to survive another one and a half years of this with *him* here??? It seems the more I try to avoid/ignore him, the more annoying he gets! Some people just don't get it. *big sigh* Still didn't have the rest of my team here to work on our group assignment today. Jeannie dubbed me team leader cuz I'm the only one who has a clue about what we're doing... and cuz I'm here. Was really looking forward to this project, but I'm already getting over it, cuz I don't think anyone else shares my enthusiasm for it, and so far I'm the only one who's seen the movie we're reviewing. (RUN LOLA RUN, for anyone who's interested. It's good stuff). So yeah, I'm just dawdling cuz I don't know what I'm meant to be doing with that and can't be bothered doing maths right now. I'm gonna get home this arvo and have to leave within half an hour cuz Michelle has got me teaching the tap class tonight before I go to my own jazz class. It's freaking me out a bit, but I don't think it'll be too hard... maybe even fun if I'm lucky! She says if I do well, she'll give me some more classes to teach, and I might end up replacing the current teacher she has (who isn't all that great). Ooh, note to self: remember to visit www.take40.com when I get home. *thumbs up* Can finally listen to stuff on the net now that we have ADSL. *scrolls up* Wow... I certainly had a bit of a ramble today! Maybe it's the new site. You gotta admit it's pretty funky! Anywho, I'm over it. Running outta stuff to talk about. I shall return. Bye for now!

We all have plans for the future and some can't wait to get there others are wishing it won't come. To think this is one of the 2 last summers left before we'll be on our own. Me I don't know what I want to do exactly I just know I want to do some thing useful. Any ways so far this summer I've watched the Dead zone (a very strange twisted show) went fishing caught nothing and watched the monk marathon season premiere starts in a hour and a half yeah.:/

24," These are just a few of the poems that I have written in my past.  Granted, they ain't the greatest, but in my eyes, they are also not the worst.  I hope if who ever does read these, enjoys them.     This first one I truely like.  Carpe Noctem By C. Kevin McBroom  Spinning yarns and  Spinning tales Of creatures of the night And of banshee wails  They say monsters do not exist Or at least so it seems Tell that to a small boys cries Or a little girls screams  As a clawed paw falls Quietly with each step Behind its opaque eyes  Many secrets are kept  The small creature stalks The night of the moon With nie a sound With a smell of doom  A light through a window Spurs the small beast on Moving swift ever silent For inside is food to feast on  A light scratch at the window Followed by a stifled cry ‘Tis only a small kitten Wanting in from the cold outside  True Thoughts By C. Kevin McBroom  I’m tired of peoples attitudes Treating me as if I am in their servitude People just don’t understand Just because I’m not Exactly as they have planned I feel as though I’m looked down on Try as hard as I might Even when I win, I haven’t won Sometimes I want to Open that final dark door If I do, would I finally win?  Friends fall wayside, as do lovers Once again I am all alone Walking solemnly through the clover Pictures race through my mind I try not to look, is it Because I’m afraid of what I’ll find? I’m better off left alone and silent No one to worry or care about No one for my heart to be sent Tears fall but I laugh in spite I close my eyes to hide myself And finally give up the fight      Personally I've always thought that one was kind of depressing, all suicidal and stuff, but for some odd reason, I still like it.  Seasons By C. Kevin McBroom  In the sleepy summer sunset  I remember your bright eyes Reassuring and softly staring Reflective of the clearest blue skies  During the wild winter winds As the snow covered the ground We walked hand in hand At night you chased away the cold dark shroud  In sun-filled spring days Your lovely laughter filled the air As we rolled in and over the clover Life was without a single care  In the sleepy summer sunsets I remember your bright eyes       I wrote that last one for my now wife.  I know it is sort of corny and hallmark-ish,(Is that a word?), but I like the picture it brings to mind and it is probably the least syrupy poem that I wrote to her.
",ND
25," I know that I am not alone in the 'loving the wrong man' line....   How many of us look for love in all the wrong places? How many of us confide in our best friends or our mothers (gasp!) that the man who is most important to us is unfortunately attached to someone else? How many of us intend for these things to happen? Probably none of us. We just seem to have a penchant for something that doesn't belong to us.....  And then I have to ask....does anyone really belong to anyone but themselves? Shouldn't we belong to ourselves? Shouldn't we do as  we  see fit?  No.... probably not. Because we harm others when we do this. Actually we harm ourselves, our psyches, our very souls.  We show ourselves to be without value. We are unimportant. We don't count. And we do this to ourselves.    Do we want to hurt others? No. I don't think that most of us even have any guilt about what we are doing. The man certainly doesn't. I seem doomed to be someone's midlife crisis. And no I am not that young. I am 48 years old and once again in the throes of a relationship that can only damage everyone involved.    He wants my address so that he can send me things. He actually called me once from his home. I asked him if he was out of his fucking mind. I don't know why I am doing this.  Because he smells so wonderfully fine and he tastes so good. Because he kisses like Kenny G's music sounds. Because everyone I want seems to be married ....or gay. Yes folks.... the guy that did my eyebrow piercing is a definite hottie and has two grown kids and an ex-wife and is definitely  uncloseted. And he twinkles and flirts and makes you want to well......I don't know lick him or something....sometimes I hate men.  This one tells me that I am his 'Whiskey Lullaby'. I am not sure if that is a compliment or not. I love the song ...but it is rather depressing and I couldn't help but ask if I was the bottle or the trigger. I guess it is supposed to be a compliment....  Listen to me piss and moan.  If you don't like the heat......get out of the kitchen.

THus begins my journey into blogging and being blogged in return... I wonder if when you say ""blogging"" it has the double consanant, or if it just holds its own against the common rules of the english language and presents itself as a non-double consanant word.

Since my parents sold their restaraunt, they've been off for a bit, but my mom just started working part time at a green house about a minutes walk from my buddy's place. So I had to get up 6:30, which sucked. She dropped me off at school around 7:00. I was feeling OK, I got to the gym, one of the senior players was there. Talked to him for a minute or two, before I worked on some ball handling and shot around a bit.   I wasn't feeling it today, dunno what happened. Nothing seemed to be fallin'. Foul shot was off, the works. But you know, that happens sometimes. Some of the senior girls showed up, we shot around and talked for a bit. Nothing special. I finished off the morning with a game or twenty-one with this kid from my team named Chance. He's gotta be my favorite Rook' on the team. Seems a lot of the other ones are bitches. I was ice cold. I barely won the damn thing. I wasn't impressed at all.   Yeah, anyway, went to Math, got my test results back. 82%. Meh, I wasn't too excited, I wasn't disappointed, but I feel I could do better. Mark went up to 77%. I'm really underachieving this semester. Parents are riding me a bit. Then I went to English, lunch came, same old, same old. French, doing OK in that. Then I went to Socials, as usual Ms. Brown was a bitch.   Hopped on the bus, went home, wasn't feeling great. Came on the computer did some shit on here. Then I went and watched Sacramento play Minnesota. I was not impressed with that missed lay-up by C-Web. Cost 'em the mother fuckin' game. Garnett was nuts, as usual.   MVP style. MVP class. MVP ability.   He's a sick mother fucker I'll tell ya that much. After the game was done I watched the end of the Calgary, San Jose game. Man, everyone here in Van-City has jumped on the Calgary bandwagon and I'm pissed OFF. They're going to the Cup, everyone couldn't be happier, except me. Bastards.   Anyway, that's today for ya. Catch ya later.   -J

29," Why is it that when ever something goes wrong or when there is some one to blame I seem to be the one every one turns to. I don't know if it is just me or if there is othere people who feel this way. For me it is hard to deal with and its sad to say, but i'm actullay not looking forward to summer vaction. Summer vaction for me is usually the worst for me because I live a way from all of my friends which means i get to spend the time with my family. The happest for me would probley be at school when i'm around people who don't judge me. My friends known or I try to remind them that what i say that is mean is just kinding around, but thats different here with my family. To me it seems that know matter what i do or what i say i feel like I can never do anything right. I'm not trying to make it seem like my life is all bad or anyhting like that I have good times and bad times but for me it seems that the bad happens more often then the good.

30," It's the middle of summer and I can't sleep, I haven't talk to my friends in a while I wonder what they been up to. Anyways I've leaned something this summer about me. One thing being why I feel depressed and why I get irritate easily. I've discovered that when I'm not with a crowd of people I don't feel depressed or get irritate easily. Which is like my brother which sucks because all school is a crowd of basically adults acting like 6 year olds.

31," It is amazing how the time of lunch comes so slowly. At work the time seems so relative, that I feel like I understand Einstein's theory of relativity, and I could even make my own contribution if I hadn't been so hungy. Sugar levels are dropping. Concentration diminishing.  As I correctly predicted the weekend was indeed cold and rainy and on the weather side really nasty. I have seen all types of rain on that day, and I do not care to see them that soon again. But otherwise the weekend was great. I was training my fiancee in driving on our fresh new car and on Sunday we went to see Kill Bill vol. 2 to another country and it was good.  Today my sister is doing university graduation exams and it seems to be going well. Not for me though, because it is hard to type when you are keeping your fingers crossed :-)

36," So, it is Friday. I am at work hoping that I am successfully pretending to be working. I do hope it works. My current job is easy to spot. Just go to  urlLink Pravda.sk  and a lot of what you see is a result of my clicking and typing. Yes, you've guessed it right. I am an online journalist surfing the news agencies for the fresh news that I may together with my co-workers offer to the hungry Slovak online audience.   Today is one especially dull day as Fridays often are. So I watch the bubbles bubbling in my mineral water bottle on my desk. It is quite relaxing, but it makes me want to pee too often. That is the price you pay.  Fridays are often filled with expectations of the coming weekend, but not today. See the rason:  The forecast forecasts forbiddingly nasty stormy rainy ugly weather.   That would not worry me too much, but it has been so nice and hot during the working days when I just had to sit here and satisfy the hunger for the news of several thousands of people. Oh well, I should better be going... read you later.

38," My Japanese friends just got back from a visit to Toronto. They found the people there much more patient and easy to communicate with than here in Gainesville, FL. And Toronto is probably the most ""Americanized"" city in Canada. Another proof that Canadians are a more considerate breed.   But why is that all Canadians envy you when they find out you're in Florida? Most of them haven't lived here, that's why. Sure, 3x the sunshine is nice. No snow is good, too. But if you ask me, the most important thing about a place is the culture of the people. Eager Canadians who head south for the warm weather will gradually come to realize there's no place like home.

41," Anyone who hates barbie will love love love this site!  Here is a song me and my friend made up to make fun of Barbie:  I’m a Barbie girl in the Barbie world. My hair is really real but my feet are just an ugly deal. I’m really, really skinny but im not really worth money. Some people think im worth the deal and some think im a rip-off for real. My clothes are cool but don’t go with me they just look good on my scene. Ohhh I’m a Barbie girl in the Barbie world I’m really fantastic and made of all plastic.  I have friends but my friends have better trends. I have a pet possum and he’s so awesome. I am really, really weak and such a freak. I have lots of wrinkles and my hair is always crinkled. I can bark like a dog but it sounds like a frog. My hair is very rare because it has an ugly glare. I work for the news and everyone hates my shoes. I like hi heels but when I walk I look like an eel. I like to eat bugs because they rhyme with rugs. People say I talk too much and that’s why the give me a little punch and people say I munch to much when I eat my nasty lunch. I’m a Barbie girl in the Barbie world I’m made of plastic its really fantastic. I have big ears and they give me lots of tears. I look really dinky just like a slinky. I’m not a kitty because im not pretty. I look like porky the pig and I know how to dig. I have so much pettiness because I’m so hideous when I got married I married something hairy that looked like my pet Gary. My very yellow hair looks like an ugly bear. Once I met the dairy fairy and she gave me my pet Gary. I’m a Barbie girl in the Barbie world I’m made of plastic it’s so fantastic. Some people say I look like a mouse and live in a tiny house. On Christmas day my mommy made me take an x-ray to see if I ate a stingray. Yesterday I got so cold that I turned into mold and that’s why this is all I have to say.  Ohhh I’m a Barbie girl in the Barbie world I’m made of plastic it’s so fantastic. Ohh I’m a Barbie girl in the Barbie world.   Barbie hater

But the ad agency where I work (www.adbiz.com) suddenly has more work coming in, and I've got two new projects on the go for freelance this week. One is search engine writing for a cosmetic surgeon's website. Another, an ad for building insurance. A lot more like this, and I'll be back in France in no time.  I've started on a couple more articles, about onsens and enkais in Japan and the glories of NS in the summer. But I have yet to finish one, since the paid stuff is taking up my time. That, and badminton! We started a club here in Gainesville, and we played for the first time two nights ago. It was fun. Some competitive people there, but for the most part, we just blissed out getting all sweaty (no a/c) and hitting the bird around.  Although it threw me for a loop when my French friend went to kiss me on the cheek instead of shaking hands after our first game. I got a little shy and forgot to do the second cheek. So we just resorted to the regular hand-shaking after that.

45," My brother and I were at a mall yesterday with two of our closest friends, Carly and Jessica.  I realized something yesterday, no matter what has happened in our lives they have always been there through good and bad times.  I realized that whenever I need someone to talk to I have always been able to count on the twins to listen and to tell me their opinions.  They have always been at our house growing up, whenever school let out, they'd be over for sure. Its hard for me to think of days when they haven't been over at our house. The four of us have done practically everything together.   They are two of my true friends. I have very few friends that I could say that about.  Not many people know me as well as these gals. Now that we are getting older our lives will most likely be keeping us from seeing each other as much as we have in the past, but I know that no matter where we are we will be friends. They have meant so much to me in my life that I can't even explain to you in this one simple blog. I have tried my best to show you, but this is only a scratch of the surface of what these two mean to me. I just hope that I have been as good a friend to them as they both have been to me.  It is there birthday today and I just want to wish a happy birthday to two of the greatest people I know.  Happy 16th.

52," this title is more of what i am looking for than what i am offering. i was looking for a way to start some good conversations on this topic but was unsure as to where i should go to do so....until now. so, that is what i am wondering. personally, i think that for the most part, the church has missed the point over the last 500 years or so but this has become more evident in recent years, as illustrated by this excerpt from ""Blue Like Jazz"":       ""In a recent radio interview I was sternly asked by the host, who did not consider himself a Christian, to defend Christianity. I told him that I couldn’t do it, and moreover, that I didn’t want to do defend the term. He asked me if I was a Christian and I told him yes. “Then why don’t you want to defend Christianity?” he asked, confused. I told him I no longer knew what the term meant. Of the hundreds of thousands of people listening to his show that day, some of them had terrible experiences with Christianity, they may have been yelled at by a teacher in a Christian school, abused by a minister, or browbeaten by a Christian parent. To them, the term Christianity meant something that no Christian I know would defend. By fortifying the term, I am only making them more and more angry. I won’t do it. Stop ten people on the street and ask them what they think of when they hear the word Christianity and they will give you ten different answers. How can I defend a term that means ten different things to ten different people? I told the radio show host that I would rather talk about Jesus and how I came to believe that Jesus exists and that he likes me. The host looked back at me with tears in his eyes. When we were done, he asked me if we could go get lunch together. He told me how much he didn’t like Christianity but how he had always wanted to believe Jesus was the son of God.""    i am not saying that i disagree with the teaching of Jesus nor with that of the Bible but rather with the fundamental ring-wing Christianity of the 20th century. what are your thoughts on christian spirituality?

I was like tired, because I had like stayed up till 3 am trying to fix my damn ghetto computer. I made something for them to eat, but one of them didn't want to eat. I got so pissed and I made her eat. She ate it and everything went fine. Then I decided to fix my computer and I tried installing another version of XP on it. It almost broke down. I was so totally freaked out! I mean god damn! Then Thomas had to call and I had to go over to Sloan's house cause he just got a multi tap. (like I cared if i he just got one!). Well I went anywayz and had a really lame time. I am not really good at video games, I mean fighting games. We then played an NBA game and I totally sucked at it. I suck at the real thing, what makes them think that I could play a fake version? When I got home, my computer was fixed and I was happy. But then I had to defrag it and I was pissed. Then I went to the upstairs computer and I started to type in my blog! I had to fix the internet connection first. While typing this, the TV said that Linkin Park has a new video coming out and it is one of my favorite songs. ""breaking the habit"" and there is a making the video at 6 pm tomorrow (i think) and I am totally psyched that they have a new video! So now i feel bored.  OMG it is a linkin park video and i am totally wanting to watch it, damn, my mom turnt it away! DARN!! Well, i dont like that vid much anyways. I have to defrag this computer now, S'later pplz!

56," Woohoo! My Very First Blog. I'm so happy. Now I'm gonna' spill my heart out like a naive little 3 year old! Or something like that.  So Today was the last actual day of school. I'm so happy, now we've got finals to do. What fun. I've got Japanese and Computer Literacy. We did nothing at school today whatsoever. It was really retarded, but it was fun, cause the teachers were somewhat intimidated and forked over tons of candy in a last ditch to maintain some semblance to order.  It worked.  During Science, M*rr*s (take that Google!) was a meanyhead, making me take the darn remote and fast forward through commercials, then count field trip money, then do this, and that, and so forth. Me no like M*rr*s. Oh well. SHE'S GONE FOREVER FROM MY LIFE AFTER THIS. I'm so freakin' happy.  History was kinda' stupid, but Micah and I chased each other around, and Ms. Yi got pissed. Japanese was kool, cause Austin and I got to sumo wrestle or something like it. Everyone was goofing off. It was awesome.  CS, I was locked in a room with Sm*th for a whole period. I was scared. He's still pissed at me, I think. Here's where background is required. He was dissing Mozilla (!), and how they were heralding ThunderBird as the next generation of email thing. Then he proceeds to diss all of Mozilla, including Composer and FireFox. Then, the final straw, he calls ThunderBird FireBird. So I tell him he's wrong and tell him that FireBird was the 1st generation of the  FireFox browser. He just kinda' stares at me. So I'm not sure whether he was really, really pissed or amazed that someone as computer illiterate as me would know that.  Skipping all other classes, I get to English with B*l*sta, 8th Period. I tried to behave in class, and this is the 4th day of the year that I managed to actually pay attention!!! But I got this pencil, and wrote on my binder, ""Blinder than a Mother-Freakin' Doorknob"" with an arrow pointing to my right.   Ms. B*l&sta walks over and has her back to me. She gives a really long, like  5 minute lecture with me holding this next to her. It was picture perfect, and Micah nerly died laughing. No kidding.  At home, I IM'd and got in fights w/ my parents. Nothing else                                         Lotsa' Love (or something like that)

57," My first blog.. Man I used to wonder what a blog really is and now am blogging  ;o)  ... I am techie from india (I know nowadays being a techie from India is very dangerous) slogging out ... enjoying myself...But have some serious doubts about certain new things that I am discovering...  Quality  is a wonderful sounding word and my initiation into Project Management exposed me to a world of  jargons, metrics, templates and of course complete non-sense . I know that I may be chided for writing that, but let me clarify. On the set I am a devotee (right word) of the world of mathematics which never ceases to amaze me and Statistics, cos its just wonderful. During one of the great training days, it was conveyed, Statistics shouldn't be employed to misrepresent the data and now I wonder if it is the whole process is to do so. Information is available very abundantly and I guess we have surplus than we can consume. I wonder if generation of information is the basis of quality. Which comes to my first question ? Does adhering to quality standards mean ""keep your common sense @ home and come"". I wonder if the purists of statistics are the ones to satisfy. Cmon.. I wonder what possible information can be derived out of one's coffee breaks, one's mails and definitely the winner, How many lines of code I can dish out ? wonder if they know that I can eternally keep on putting braces, new lines, comments, star, hashes etc and they all contribute to code. Yeah Yeah I know, we have tools that can take care of these, but is this an indicator of a person's ability... Wonder what good is the information for... Begs the second question.. I get the common answer.. information may be useful down the line.. Yes it may be and may not be.. Going by the theory of probability it is equi-probable... I guess quality is used to ensure that the product being manufactured is in accordance with the best-practices in the industry (for starters) and more importantly, you learn from your current process to refine the same.. I think refinement is the catch and I guess it can be done in more than one way than generate some junk metrics..Wonder how the process can be refined from measuring no. of lines dished out in a day... Look forward to people's views... Hey feel free to drop in and drop a line... Hope this blog goes a long way... Time to hit off...

NO time to buy the ingredients, so decided to not go. And in the morning, went to school still feeling giddy and blur. Went to the biology lab straight after flag raising. Found out that the Stupid Yongyee was counting everybody's marks! STUP UP PLEASE! YOU already know you are the top! SO SHUT YOUR TRAP OKAY? keep going around announcing you are the top and provoking people. Your results may be good, but your character stinks, it is no wonder you got a D for your CME. I hate you! everytime i see you, i thought i am seeing a walking stick insect walking around the class... And thank you very much to the person who brought the mark sheet home! YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSE TO BRING IT HOME UNDERSTAND! MRS TOH DID NOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT YOU BEING INCHARGE OF IT! SICK MAN! Do you mind respecting other people privacy?? huh? met mr loh while me and meiqing were about to go home! he gave us really good advice man! really the best teacher i ever met! For my math teacher, sigh... speechless... i agree tt we did not work hard enough... but for our class... sigh again... SOMEBODY HELP US!!! I AM REALLY STRESSED ABOUT EVERYTHING, even though it is after the exam and i thought tt i can finally relaxed, but no. The ELDDS DRAMA IS DRIVING ME KUKU! KUKU!

59," Well it started of ok, I did some exercising.  Then I went to the drug store to price the perscription I have been carrying around with me, and had never gotten it filled.  I found out to have it filled it would be 130$.  My god what do they think I am made of, Money? Well anyway, I won't be getting that anytime soon.  Then when I came home Pat made a really good stir fry for supper.  But then Karmen was really cranky tonight and my cat got hit by a car.  The cat's ok though so that was good. I have had such a day of ups and downs. But I am still able to say I had an ok day.  I still don't know how to post pictures on here.  But when I can I will put a picture of my beautiful baby doll.  She is positively gorgeous.  I have a job interview next week and I am really nervous. I don't know how well it will go with no voice, and I get nervous in interviews.  When I get nervous I ramble.  So I have started preparing I have over 200 questions I am going to plan the answers too, I am going to plan the questions I am going to ask them at the end and I am researching the company.  That is all I can do besides remembering to breathe.  I just feel I have to make an extra big impression perferably on the good side, since I don't have much of a voice.  So any advice you can give me for my interview would be great:) I hate interviews.  I can write wicked resumes and a good coverletter, but I suck at the talking to people. They intimidate me, and I can not seem to picture people in their underware no matter how hard I try. I never know what to wear to interviews either.  I always feel like I am under dressed for them.  I don't own a ""business suite"", what I have are dressy clothes but to me they don't scream interview clothes.  Anyway I think I have rambled enough for today.

60," Why is it when something negative comes my way I run and hide? I push away all the people that I truly care about  and I  crawl in to a dark closet with in my mind and slowly shut down. I still to this day don't know how to take rejection when all my life its all I had you would think id be used to it by now, I was never good enough for my mother all the guys I dated treated me like shit  what did I do to deserve this? All I ever wanted was to be loved unconditionally, now I see my self unable to give the love that is needed to my beautiful daughters, why cant my daughters love be good enough for me? Why do I need the love and approval of a man to  fulfill me ?? I just don't understand  where I went wrong in my life!

62," I started talkin to this awesome guy I had met on  plentyofish.com about  two weeks ago we would talk every night for at least 5 hours a night.  He seemed to be everything I wanted in a man and he had made  me believe that I was everything he wanted in a woman, we had shared pictures a lot of pictures so he new what I looked like and I new what he looked like, well this guy was just to good to be true just a wonderful man he would tell me he loved me and how he wanted a future with me. He decided that he had to come see me so after two weeks of talkin and getting to know eachother through conversation  he shows up on my door step at around 1 am on Saturday morning. I aswered the door and he was just as beautiful as his pictures but I could tell I wasn't everything he imagined id be. I still had a day and a half with this guy and I new he didn't like me the way he said he did because of the way I looked can you imagine the heartache of rejection when its slapped in your face?Well he ended up staying the whole time and we had a nice time, we took my girls to see a movie and he came to my mothers house for dinner and what not! We did sleep together but I feel like he did it out of pity for me. It just hurts to be rejected by someone who tells you they love you and how beautiful you are,I told him how scared I was to meet him cause I didn't want to disappoint him but he said ""what do you think I'm a shallow person? I think your beautiful and I want to be with you"". So now here I am 2 days later not one phone call from him and a broken heart to deal with!

63," So these two girls published an article in the school newspaper about the cliques in my school. It's a horrible article. Like, get shot in the head and die. In it they listed what cliques exist at my school--The Asians (it's funny they list that as the first one, because thats the 'clique' they belong to) the Brown kids, The Ghetto Group, The Cheerleaders/Jocks/Preps, the Punks, the Goths and the Druggies. Okay, what the hell? There are 3 kids at my school that could be labeled punk. Two of them are actually Punks, and one of them is a good friend of mine. The other one is a girl who used to be punk, but now she's all...not. This entire article is about how we shouldn't be labeling kids because HEY!  That's what causes cliques!  And then they go and categorize every student at the school? Assholes.  And then, they thought it would be nice to teach me about these cliques.  Students feel acceptance and approval when they are with their ""own people"". How does one come to be labeled as a part of one of these cliques? The way one speaks, dresses common interests and tracking levels.   Tracking levels? Okay! I have no idea what that means.    Students who can be categorized in more than one clique are considered ""confused"". For Example, we were listening to two studens in our class talk about a boy who likes to dress more urban but he listens to rock music at the same time. People were making fun of the boy behind his back saying he was ""confused"".  Cry me a fucking river.  The article goes on about stupid shit. Saying that the two most segregated clubs in my school are DECA and the Multicultural Club. Ironically, THEY'RE IN BOTH.  Oh, I don't want to join that club...It's so...Asian  What the hell. People use that as an excuse?  They ended it by saying that the only way to change this is to make a difference...within. Fucking Hippies.  On that note, all i have to say is...    We can dance if we want to, we can leave your friends behind  'Cause your friends don't dance and if they don't dance  Well they're no friends of mine     Amen.

Finally, last night went there with my best friend. at first, i thought i will be deadly late then i sms her and told her that i might be late. who knows she just took the train right before me! so after she alight a while, i be there with her! feel like luckly...  then we planned to dine at foodcourt... walk walk walk... foodcourt seems disappear... so we asked the security guard.

All of us thought it will stop before the edge... who knows it just walk walk walk and go through the audience. Those sitting audience quickly stand up and move away. For those standing of course just ""dan hoi""(canto) la  After the show, we watch New Asia performance. The Indian drummer really terro~~ He called as Kamar. The speed and his finger strength really incredible! I fancy the another modern drummer. Tama Goh dont know i spell it correct or not... later check out his detail...i mean i will try  He looks like so serious and when he play drum he kept looking at Kamar direction! I feel like he is challenge kamar when he played the drum as solo performance.  Really a nice trip... can meet up with my best friend.

It was like i had no worries and it just felt liberating. My family is big. i have ten aunts and uncles just on my dad's side of the family. i love my dad's side of the family it is so much fun and we always get together for dinners and parties, and everyone eats and drinks and has a good time. i go to private school now but when i get to high i will be in a public school. private school is ok but i can't wait to experience public. i have to wear a plad jumper and i have been in this same small school all of my lif. i have never gone to school without a uniform, except for jean days which dont happen often. i am short have light brown hair brown eyes and i weigh around 100 lbs. i love basketball and was already invited to play varsity basketball my freshmen year of high school. i love shoppin' and i always like looking good. i like getting my nails done but usually can't afford it. i hope you lik emy blog and now i'm an official bloger.  p.s i just learned about blogging and how it is addicting...for whoever is addicted to blogging right now think if you have neglected a family member or friends or anyone who is special to you, and get off your computer now and spend some of your time with them. In my researches i read that 2.5 million ppl are addicted to bloggin.

70," Well I finally got around to trying out this blogger- even though I've had the google toobar for ages, *and* was a loyal googler long before that.  Silly me.  I first tried to blog with a different blogger site, and To Tell You The Truth, I didn't like the feel.  Oh, it was simple enough, if awkward, but the 'home' page of the blogging site was so darn busy I felt lost there.     This place is so much better. I should have gone with what I knew was a tried and true service.  Anyways, this is my dumping ground.  Stuff I find on the internet that I must squawk about (good and bad), late night frustrations and nightmares, and the occasional proud parenting moment (or self flaggellation over same)-- all will be posted here so I can embarrass my family and bore strangers.  I hope you'll drop in occasionally.

73," They say when it rains it pours and boy are they right.  Things that have happend to me this month-- graduation, birthday, mother's day, breakdown of both vehicles at the worst possible time, frustrating treading of water re the fixing of the lawnmower, which means my grass is waist high now.  Then He Who Is Mine went and tore his bicep off the bone-- surgery to reattach it was just Thursday.  Now he's on a forced three month medical leave, crippled up and unable to do anything with his arm in a splint, *and* because his injury happened at home, he's not eligible for light duty at work, therefore he's out of luck on the paycheck department.  So.  I've put in my app in several places the last few days and told the boss to expect a phone call or three but please don't think I'm leaving (are you kidding? This job is manna from heaven).  I also spent the day (and half the night) futzing around with an old computer trying to get it ready so my MIL can use it at work. In the process, I have made it so that DH's compter... the one with EQ installed mind you... won't even boot.  I will have to spend a week futzing around with that one too to figure out why.  Plus I got a virus during all this nonsense.     I am bushed already, and I've got three months to go.  I just wish a magic genie would come clean my house and yard.

74," This is my first attempt at keeping any sort of journal. I have never been very good at keeping any sort of record of my life. I have always had the fear that once an experience is put on paper, the brain no longer has a need to remember it and the memory is thus discarded, or rerouted for use in another way. Therefore, I am rather skeptical to put much of note down here too soon. Perhaps my mind ramblings will be just that, ramblings, nothing more, nothing less. Or, perhaps, I will learn that the more I jot down, the more I will be able to remember. The brain never ceases to amaze me. It remembers things long since forgotten, in a way...Perhaps that is where DeJaVue comes from. I am constantly in a state of rememberance, that is the way that I know I am on the right track in life. Whenever I don't get a memory of something that I am doing that I know I have never done before, I know that what I am doing is that which I am supossed to be doing. My life, otherwise, might get very complicated and then where would I be?  A friend from my childhood has had a very trying life and started blogging to sort things out. I am very proud of her for that. She is who made me decide to try it. I don't really have an outlet for my life, my husband has a hard time understanding my need for higher and higher education. That is not to say that he is not supportive or encouraging by any means, it is just that he felt a Bachelors degree was all that was really needed. I, on the other hand, feel that I need to get more. I am in the process of completing my BA in Molecular Biology and a minor in Chemistry, only to persue a DVM/PhD combo in the next 6yrs.  Perhaps I will obtain that goal, but for now I am just looking forward to finally obtaining my first degree...and it has only me since 1996...3 years sabatical for work and my son...etc, basically life in general... Well, that is it for my first blog, perhaps next time it will be more insightful.

83," car shopping today went well. i'm really looking at two cars, the nissan spectra and the a saturn coupe. both have the basics that i want, sporty look, power everything, sunroof, standard transmission etc. the spectra has got more balls than the saturn but i think i'll get a better deal with the saturn. this is my first experiance buying a NEW car. soo many choices, i feel like a kid in a candy store..hehe  still no real resolution on the female issue. seems as though it get more complicated whichever way i go, so i think my plan is going to be to just ride out the storm and hope for a better days in the future. i know i know not a very creative solution but i honestly can't think of anything else.  on a different note i was thinking about the relationship my generation has with their work. my parents worked three jobs when they were younger and to this day i haven't know them to complain about it. they saw it as a chance to make money and as simply doing what you needed to do. it's strange that just one generation later we see people who can barely handle working one fulltime job and endlessly complain about how much they do. i really believe if we worked harder as a generation we would not only do better personally but do more for each other. not to get too religious but catholics believe that forgiveness/redemption is not based on faith alone but also on good deeds. maybe if we did more for each other on a regular basis we would all be better off, then again that's just my opinion...

Just some numbers, and there she is, on the other end of the line, giving me good advice and comforting me. Francina is really the only comfort i find in this new school. I felt happy, glad to be her friend and know that i can always trust in her. *sigh* Today, she is going off to Holland. Passed me some of her books that are due by Friday before she left and i gave her a feather for good luck. I shall miss her when she is gone...I really hope for a better day tomorrow man...haiz...

86," It was a good movie. You should go see it if you haven't already. It was really funny. Today was a pretty normal day. I had my cousins over the night before. We got up and ate breakfast and then basically didnt do anything. Micheal had to leave and play in the band fora  memorial service. So me and brent just hung out. It was pretty cool. We drove the gator and got really muddy. we then jumped on the trampoline. That was kinda cool. Then we took him home. I went to kohls then and then went to sams. I went home and slept for a while, then rode the gator, and got really muddy.. I then tooka shower and got ready to go out. Then I went and saw Shrek 2. It was really funny. They used some stuff from some older movies so some of the stuff some of the kids didnt understand. well thats all that happened today. i think im gonna go to bed. until next time.

87," So alot of weird shit has been happening to me lately. For some reason, a reason which ill-ludes me, I can not seem to have a normal everyday boring relationship. There always seems to be some kind of drama or opstical. One of my more intelligent female friends seems to think it's because I don't choose the right kind of women, i should remind her that there aren't many women out in the world like her. Well if anyone has any tips on what is the right kind of women, I'm open to suggestions. Maybe it's that I just don't know what I want. I suppose when one thinks about it, my issues aren't that different then anyone elses but that doesn't help me feel like i'm not alone in this deal. I guess when it comes to these situations, in the end we are all really just alone in a crowd...

We  spent 17 hours in the car this past weekend going to my friend Jared's  wedding and we will be going to Jessica's wedding theis weekend. we haven't  killed each other so that is really impressive.

She has been handling the move well even though I know she misses her  friends back in Colorado.  I am considering taking a Youth Ministry position at Fellowship of the  Metroplex. It is a fairly large church wich I am not a big fan of but I am  praying over with Heather and we need your prayers to help us with the  decision. We are also considering some other options of ministry and would  appreciate your prayers. Thanks for everyone's help and support.  Jake

93," Last Sunday I completed my first long run, 5 miles. Not bad. I followed the suggested training regimen this week, even the Friday cross-training session. My packet of training info suggested that “pool running” was, “…hands down the best cross-training activity for runners…”. I decided since I bought a swimsuit last fall, I would put it to good use at Yale's Olympic-sized pool.   The only person in the area who didn't think I was a complete idiot was the undergraduate student lifeguard, whom I informed of my intent to “pool run”. He was a member of the Yale swim team, and, “very familiar with pool running.” He proceeded to describe types of pool running exercises, and while trying to explain one in particular, asked me if I was familiar with water polo. I replied, “No, but I know how to play Marco Polo.” Unfortunately, my childhood days of Marco Polo training proved insufficient…   Referring to pool running, the article states that, “… it looks a little odd.” Well, they were right. All 15 or so people at the pool, including the children trying to play around in the lane next to me, thought I was a complete whack-job. To give you a better idea of what pool running looks like, think of a common dream you might have had or heard of - you know, the one where someone is chasing you and you're running but not going anywhere? It's like that, but add to your mental picture: 8 lanes of professional swimmers, 1 lane of 3 kids trying not to stare, a swim cap, goggles, and Melissa Bourgeois trying to “run” to the other end of the pool without drowning. That's pool running.   Although I looked like a total ass in the pool, I felt great afterwards, much unlike I feel today. It seems I have either mild food poisoning or a stomach virus – either way, I can't even think of food without wanting to vomit. Suffice it to say I will not make my 6 mile long run today, which I am very disappointed about. It's only going to make my 7 miler next week that much harder. I'm trying to get as much rest as possible today so I can try to make up the long run tomorrow. We'll see. Right now I'm going to head for the couch and a little comedy central…

94," Okay... If i wrote about my situations w/my ex, i would have a huge fucking post, so I've decided not to write about boys at all. It's been FUCKIN' MADNESS!!!!   So.... um.....  uh.... let's see... It's FRIDAY!  Yay!!!!  This weekend is the Apalachin Fireman's Field Days.  Tonight i'll be taking my daughter to watch the fireworks.  Tomorrow i'll be taking her to my aunt's to watch the parade go up the street and go to the Field Days to ride rides and stuff.  That's exciting.   Yesterday i went to one of those Adult Bookstores all by myself!  How creepy.  It was like me and 10 hairy greasy icky men.  I bought a lovely blue ""personal massager"" w/a dolphin on it to give my clitoris the special attention that it deserves.  I took it up to the guy to pay for it and he was like ""I have to test it"", so of course, i giggled b/c i thought he was joking.  It turns out he was serious... i guess they have a ""no refund, no return"" policy (which makes sense), so he had to take it out of the box and put batteries in it and make sure it worked AND IT DIDN'T!!!  So i had to go get another one!!!  It was very awkward, but the guy was really cool about it.    Other than that, i guess i have no news. Ta ta.

95," 1st blog ever. I'm sure that by tomorrow I'll forget I even started this whole blog thing... Maybe not tho'.  We'll see.    Oh... what to talk about???  Umm... I dumped my boyfriend this weekend.  Now I have to move all my shit, including a piano, couch, entertainment center, etc., out of his house.  That sucks.  He's a cool guy, but unfortunately, cannot be honest.  He has a serious lying problem.  I have given him  plenty  of chances and this weekend was the last straw.  Hopefully this will be a wake up call and he won't fuck up future relationships the same way.  Good luck to him.   Now I am at work.  I am a Customer Relations rep for a utility company.  Everyone that calls hates me.  Makes for a long day.   I had a horrible dream last night that the world was ending due to global warming and I had no choice but to die a slow and painful death.  Thank you ""Day After Tomorrow"" previews!  It was a great way to start a great day. :)    The upside is that today is TUESDAY!!!  Only 3 and a 1/2 more shitty days left 'til the weekend. YAY!!!!!

98," Heather and I have spent the last two weekends at weddings and over 27 hours in the car. Suprisingly we did not kill each other and got along fine.  It was a little nerve racking to perform Jessica' s wedding but it was an honor to do it. I just didn't want to screw up the day she would remember forever.      Heather is doing well since she has moved here. She has already found a job that I think she will enjoy. She is going through training right now so she is not really getting to do her actual thing yet. She is working at Church's Home for Children and will be working with kids around the 8-12 age.  She will do and excellent job.   We have officially started the wedding plans. This past Sunday we went to Guest Island Ranch in Ames to see if we could have our reception or rehearsal dinner there. It was pretty interesting especially with my overdramatic dad there.   We liked it a lot and to be honest there are not a large number of options.  So we will see on how it goes. Be praying that we can plan a fun wedding but one that is reasonable and cheap. Anyway it will be good to hear how everyone is doing.  Jake  Here is a pic of us in Germany

100," Hey ya'll! Today was MUCH better than yesterday! Well, I didn't let things get to me as much as I did yesterday! Anyway, its kinda funny. Well the other day, Monday I think, me and Ryan Larson were throwing a plastic bottle on the bus and I threw it at him and it went out the window instead cause I missed. the bus driver didn't turn it in till today, and I got called up to the office during first period. I dont care though, I only got a hour of ASD. Its my first time too so its not that big of a deal. But the thing that pisses me off is that Ryan didn't get ANYTHING! He was flicking me with a rubber band! Hmmm...well what else happened? I had the oral in spanish today, it was easy. After school Ashley came over. It was so funny, we were wired! She's the best friend ever! I can't wait till the weekend. I'm not sure what I'm doing on Friday night, but Saturday I haveta go to a cousins wedding in South Carolina. It'll be fun! Sunday is Ashleys birthday so hopefully we can hang out.    Well I hope ya'll had a good way too! Just think...6 more days left of school! YAY! I'm excited! Love ya'll! MWAH :-*

101," If you want my life you can have it...   Hey everyone its Chris Here once again... I haven't written in this a lot, but here it is. Um Well I am not going out with Victoria anymore, and a lot has happend. Well I am out of school finally and I am not grounded. I feel really happy right now... I feel important.. Never really felt that way before. My new girlfriend Georgia has made me really happy inside, ya know? She makes me feel like I actually am important and thats a great feeling. My ex-girlfriend got really mad cause I was friends with girls, and cheated on me. Eh it was really dumb, and it was a friend of mine. And then she dumped me and said I could go out with anyone I would want, so I went out with Georgia. It felt like 9 months went down the drain and all that stuff. But finally yesturday she said she was sorry and ""demanded"" me to take her back. I told her I didn't wanna deal with it and move on with my own life, but I would like to be a good friend still. She got really angry and hung up the phone. Today She called me back and said she was sorry, then I told her I respect everything she says and all of her desicions. Since we broke up though I didnt really like the fact that she was trying to get me jealous by saying she is a whore by doing stuff with about literally 8 guys and going out with another... the same guy she cheated on me with. Its cool though We all take bumpy rides on the coaster of life, but we will come back. What one said before... What doesn't kill us only makes us stronger. I have become more self-dependant.. I feel more happy about it also and shit wont put me down as much... Other then that, The new Slipknot CD is awesome.

103," There are things running through my head today.  What should I do about my future.  I have a decent job, an apartment, a relationship, but  what do I want to do with my life?   There are many things I've wanted to do.  When I was in high school I wanted to be a broadcaster.  When I was in college, while things became less clear, I knew that I wanted to study English and Tudor history and combine them somehow or another.  Now that I'm out of school, all I want is to go back - to do something different; to be something more than what I am.    So, here are some things I've thought about doing.  I haven't really thought them through all the way, but that's what this sort of forum is for, right?    I've always wanted to write books.  Either researching stuff from the Elizabethan or early Tudor time period, or historical based romances or even just plain old fiction.  The problem is - what would I write about?  There are already tons of books about Elizabeth I, her sister Mary, her cousin Mary Stuart...it's a bit frustrating.  But, I suppose there's always room for a well researched, well written book out there.    I've thought about studying to become a teacher.  But, what would I teach?  English or History?  On what level would I teach?  I'm not the most patient person in the world...I'd hate teaching in an elementary school or even a middle school.  So, I guess that leaves high school and college levels.  I'd enjoy having the summers off, but probably not much else.  I'd love to be able to travel for 3 months out of every year.  Or even travel for 1 month and work the other 2 doing something else.  It's a possibility I guess I should look into.    The law has also fascinated me from a young age.  I'd love to be a lawyer.  I should look into law schools, at least to find out the requirements.    All in all, I think what I'm doing now is good for me - it's making me question what I   should  be doing and what I  could  be doing.  That's never a bad thing, is it?

105," HEY WHATSUP...i doubt anyone will ever ever read this...least on a regular basis...but who does? ya i just needed a place to put everything down on paper...or w/e this stuff is made out of... and also i made this for all those boring days in the summer where this just might cross your mind and then u can read it...so if u read it then awesome, this is just mostly me talking to whoever wants to hear aight...aight......so ya comment if u have any other enlightening comments u wanna make or if u just wanna make fun of me...Thanks...i appreciate it...o YA Jenilee thanks with the hard thought naming process...        So i guess ill start this whole thing by telling a funny story...ya it happened i guess 3 days ago and anyways i was at this grad. party @ the duffies and well it was pouring down rain of course and everyone and their cat was there. So i had to go and park half a mile down the road  and run to their house in the flood...and ya i know im dumb but i wore those really cheap old navy sandals and well lemme tell ya... you cant run in themm...especailly if theyre wet...ya basically im saying that i fell on the way there but i eventually got there and it was packed out... but the food was good and the people were cool so i had fun for the most part until i discovered the chips and hot sauce...IT WAS SOOO good...i loved it..it just set ur mouth on FIYYYAA  but not too much and ya it was goodddd. So you would probably think thats a good thing but i was chilln upSTAIRS and so i'd have to go up n down em to get more...well so i run outta chips and so i get up to go down for more and im headin down the stairs and i catch glance of this amazingly hott girl(not sayin who) and well i guess i lost focus for a second cuz my hand with the plate of hot sauce hit the side rail and i missd a step and ya the plate toppled all over the white carpeted stairs... and all over mrs. stark who was sitting on them for some reason?? so ya it was embarrasing...especially asking mrs duffie for something to clean it up with... mrs stark wasnt mad..PHEW and it ended up bein alrite besides the embarrassment...so basically the moral of the story is Never NEVER eat the hot sauce at those so called ""GRAD PARTIES"". just don't...its not worth the risk...the RUSH is only for a second...but the consequences they never go away...so DONT...Do...GRAD Hot SAuce...       THE MORE YOU KNOW...

Oh well, and I should be studying for exams, but if I sit in a chair, I just feel like fainting. Oh, and my mother is a bitch. My computer isn't working and she refuses to call Dell up to fix the problem! Ugh!  Meanwhile, when I EVENTUALLY fall asleep, all I can dream about is my damn Biology exam.

109," Alright, this is my first Blog post. So, I guess i'll write about what happened today. Well, just like the res of this week, I went to sleep at 4a.m. thanks to my damn headaches. So, I missed school, again. I supposed it can't be helped with all my damn problems, and the operation I had last week but anyway.   I got exams next week! Not good, I only started studying an hour ago, and the exam's on Monday. Of course, i've always been one to procrastinate with my work and studying, it's just that now I have an excuse as to why i'm going to fail! Sigh!   This weirdo called ""Yen-Po"" wants to come to my house. He's this weird homosexual with alot of issues. I'm not sure I want to see him because he said he ""wants to see me"" which conjures up some pretty vivid images in my sick little mind.   I had a really weird dream last night. I was at the cinema, eating popcorn. Out of no where i'm sleeping in a bed with some weirdo and they are holding a cane. At that point I woke up, and then when I went back to sleep I had rather enjoyable dreams about my school, and how I was causing it mass destruction. Ahh, the joys of an unconcious mind.  Well, this is it for my first post, i'll be back later - Kalinixta.

118," I awoke this morning in a foul mood.  Why??  I don't really know.  I had become a little testy on the phone with my girlfriend last night but not enough to justify it carrying over to the next day.  One thing I do know is it is setting the precedence for the rest of the day, which isn't really surprising as once I get in a foul mood it is extremely hard to pull myself up out of the trenches of self loathing and hatred.  I've been at work for the last 4 hours and have thus far accomplished nothing, at least a lot more nothing then what I usually accomplish while at work.  In recent times I have slipped from a model employee to the try to do as little as possible disgruntle employee, reason being my boss recently hired a new employee and our office is turning into a good ole boys club where I being of the opposite sex feel out of place.  I work at a university and have worked in the same department for the past four years, my official job title is Computer Support Assistant yet my responsibilities have grown much since I started gainful employment here.  Yet now I’m feeling under appreciated as the new guy is getting paid more than me and is perhaps destined, in the near future, for a pay rise, just to stick the knife in a little deeper.    You could argue that his job title carries more clout then mine as he is officially known as a Web Developer, yet I as a lowly old Computer Support Assistant should technically be paid less, yet it appears that I have moved from the illustrious realm of shit kicker to web developer over the years, yet I still kick the shit when ever someone is in.  Technically we should be on an equal playing field, yet this too doesn’t seem to be the case.  Because I have been here the longest I am given the added responsibility of maintaining our servers while my boss lays on a beach somewhere smelling of coconut oil and slowly burning flesh.   But alas it is not to be, I must suffer in silence, I know I’ve not been very silent.  I do however feel much better now after this little venture, perhaps my foul mood was simply due to pent up frustrations which have since subsided as a result of this writing.  I feel better now and perhaps well enough to do some real work.

126," so yesterday I was going though my old bookmarks and then I found the one that was my boyfiends, from right before we met till a short time after (a few days) then he said he removed it since he never had time to post and it was all about his ex anyway... so I clicked the little book mark and what do i see but a bunch of horable things about me, and i admit i am a bitch but, i have been really great as far as moods and that shit latly, so whats the deal right? the past few months i have been cooking, at least two dinners a night, do laundry for 7, some dishes ( he does seem to help with that on and off) then i get to fold and find a place for all the laundry, hope like hell i get time to eat dinner, and go to bed way to late, and get up way to early to start the day with most the time all 5 kids fighting, not getting ready, and still trying to get everyone out the door before 7:30. We drop off a few kids here and a few there, then i go to work for 5-8 hours, doing what? you might ask, well *fucking housekeeping*** what fun RIGHT? So everyday this is my day, and sometimes i have to go to the store and pick up more food for a bunch of ppl that dont care if i cook i guess cuz they dont always (rather, hardly ever) eat what i make.  So what i mean by two faced, i mean why would i do all this for more then me and my own kids if i didnt think he loved me, i thought so  untill i read what i read, and that isnt the first time he has been known to talk all that shit about me,  so what am i doing I ask... self what the hell are you doing, this is looking like a realationship of convienence and not of love, or even lust or any of the good stuff. at least that is how i am starting to get the feelings from him, im just here, ruining his life for him, everything is my fault, geting old friends it really is. AND thats all i have to say about that....  on a lighter side, my youngest offspring, cut all her hair off on her own last night, she said she was ""fixing her bangs""  guess she was going for that bangs all around look...

128," So how many blogs do I have now? Let's count...probably 4, and I usually only use one which is Dead Journal. But hey, I want a new taste...so I'm gonna use blogger again. For the 3rd time? lol   It was (still is) very windy today. I like this cool breeze...although it was really hot today.   The moment I got up today I knew I was going to have a good day, cuz I woke up briskly and eager to go to Saturday School. But now that I think about it...today was a REALLY tiring day. The most tiring day I've ever had at Saturday School maybe. I mean HAL!! Hal is SO GODDAMN loquacious! (Hahah, there goes my vocab again...) He would NOT shut up!! We did show and tell again and he would make either a sarcastic remark or a ""Oh I have that"" to everything everyone says. YOU SMARTASS!! And then for HIS show and tell, guess what he gets out... fossils and anmonites.  He even made this presentation-board type of thing. And he talks back to me, says mean things that he doesn't mean, etc...that kid absolutely drives me  mad.  But what the hell, at least he's somewhat entertaining...half the laughter in that class is caused by Hal's smartness (and stupidness...today he said 'Stupidity counts in everything.' Daresama yanen...lol) . Talked to Victor today, was nice...he's so cute, hehe. It's so weird how my heart jumps whenever I see him. But his hideous sense of BAGS and HATS are disturbing...lol I guess he likes that military color combination...  Yusuke, Hiroaki, and I were gonna go to a movie tonight but since we found out it ends at 9:05, we cancelled it...plus we might not have gotten tickets, we were planning to see  Day After Tomorrow . That comes out today! So then we planned to go out to dinner, but since I finish work at 5 we postponed that as well. lol   Apparently I might be going to prom with Hiroaki...? Yusuke and Jyongri persuaded him to go with me, and it might just happen! It all depends on if he has the whole outfit though, I hope he does. Well whatever, I'm not too concerned with going dateless after all. As long as we all have a good time...  Speaking of packing, I leave in  15 days!!!  Do you read that Courtney, I'LL BE IN THE SAME GODDAMN COUNTRY IN 15 DAYS! I'll be sure to give you a call when I get to Indiana kk? ;) Ahhhh I'm so excited...XD XD   I must go do homework now. Adios amigos.

129," This is the product of idle time. Usually phone support during queue time does not give us this much idle time, that is until you are one of two who have a direct customer service split. Then you get to sit around and do nothing but wait for one of two tiny lights to come on for you to answer the phone. Lucky for me this phenomenon does not happen very often on weekends. Therefore I am left here contemplating the future, browsing for new platform games, twiddling my thumbs, and feeling a little guilty because the rest of my team is busy taking calls. Not that I really mind the rest, but you kind of wish everybody else was resting with you. Right now I really wish I were home already inflicting pain upon my thumb by pushing on a little analog stick on my PS 2 but then again I come in and work all night so I can pay for my little electronic addiction. Of course I think I'm rambling now because I really just don't have that much to do, so if this were a piece in English class I would probably flunk because of the lack of coherence in this post. Then again since its not then I think I'll ramble on, that is if I get to think of anything more to ramble about. Hmmm, the light came on interrupting my train of thought, but I'm back now. Now I'm wondering how I'm going to fund my CD habit. I really want to get my own copies of so many discs now I think I'm going to drive myself crazy thinking about where all my money went. After I get my credit card bill gets to me that is, but then again at least CD's are tangible and they happen to be mine. I think this is enough rambling for this first foray into the world of blogs lets just see what happens next.

134," Hello. I'm so glad you've come. Would you like a cup of tea? I like mine with two heaped spoons of sugar and full-cream milk. But you can have yours any way you like. I'm not going to stop you.   Well, I might as well introduce myself, since you've made it this far. And you look like you're comfortable so I've got nothing to lose.    My name is Mrs Walker and I am 26 years old. I live in a pink square house on Harlem Avenue, in a working class neighborhood ten miles west of the Chicago loop. My husband, Mr. Walker, and I, bought the house in April and we moved in on May 1.   Our house is different from other houses. From Harlem Avenue, our house looks just like a pink square lego brick that's come alive and has grown eyes and a mouth. In front of the house is a strawberry field and there are five fruit trees on our double lot. We have grape vines growing over the deck and peonies, roses and other exotic looking flowers exploding all over our Chicago plot. On the other half of the lot (it's a double) are neat blocks of soil divided by wooden walkways. We have planted corn, brocolli, carrots, beans, tomatoes, peppers and herbs here. Every day my husband and I look on in astonishment as the plants rise up out of the ground in their mission to feed us.   When we first looked at the house in March this year, we had no idea what was already in the ground. The stawberry plants, berries and grapevines have all burst forth since we moved in. In the last two weeks we have picked perhaps half a dozen pounds of strawberries. We've given away baskets to friends and I took a couple quarts into the office one day. We've made strawberry jam and I tried strawberry fudge but I didn't wait for the mixture to get hot enough and it didn't set. I threw the whole pan of fudge out and only had to feel guilty about the dollar or so that I spent on the can of evaporated milk, and the three cups of sugar.   Well, that is not exactly true. I was sorely devastated by my failed fudge attempt and I bought new ingredients at the grocery store today. In fact I'm going to attempt a new batch again right now. If it turns out alright this time, I'll share the recipe with you.   So please come back to visit. Next time I may even have a chocolate biscuit for you to eat with your tea.

We had a group of 8 planned to get together and hang out there and raise money for cancer but, that's where the problem was...RELYING ON PEOPLE! Our team captain and another member were in Europe for out school's Orchestra class, 2 people came...and left without letting anyone know, 1 person came, but had to leave early cause she had to work, which was perfectly understandable. So, that left 3 of us...me, Kendra, and Lucas (I know names mean nothing to those of you that don't know me but, get over it). It was from 6 p.m. last night til 8 a.m. this morning, so we stayed up all night walking our school's track, where it was held. We had alot of fun!

The other nanny is going to be gone for the whole day and the baby nanny really doesn't help me all that much... none of the kids were in bed before 9:30 (not my fault) and the mom is home. This morning was fine the kids and I were joking around all the way to school so the day started off with laughs and smiles. Then I took the 3 year old to pre-school and we had no problems... I picked him up we had a good lunch and afternoon he fell asleep right away for his nap and the mom is picking the kids up from school..    I found out yesterday that I passed the praxis which is huge for me cuase now I am a certified teacher in the state of Ohio. Whew!! I also got a call on my way to play practice (more about that later) about a job at a school really close to my home town. I am so excited. The principal isn't even asking me to apply just send her a resume and plan on going in for an interview. I had done an experience there and she wants to hire me.. I am almost about to burst!!  I leave for Fl in like 5 days and I am so ready for it!!   so I have been going to this church here and there are these 3 great fun guys my age there. Well the pastors wife, youth pastors wife and the church secretary have all decided that they want me to stick around here. So it has recently been their goal to hook me up with one of these guys. nice huh... Well I was asked to be in this skit for friend day at church and yup sure enough they are all in it adn I am ""married"" to one.. yup... so any time I see one of the ladies they say something and i turn bright red.. yea nice..

But the rest is done, or at least done enough that it might be considered enjoyable rather than annoying. Then again some people are annoyed by almost everything enjoyable. One can't make everyone happy.   I decided that a Blog might be a nice addition as I need a place to whine without having to upload a new whiners page to my site. Not that I will always whine here, but since I have the opportunity, I suppose I could. I could also leave the page absolutely blank, and make people wonder what I was up to. Well maybe just my paranoid visitors. Most people probably wouldn't care.   There's that word probably. Chances are, you will not see that word typed on a page of mine often.

157," Well, all in all things are going well. Day two went well yesterday and I tried to report it to my journal on www.BFL101.com but it is down. Since Monday a.m. I've dropped 4 1/2 lbs of water weight (who's kidding who here - I KNOW it is water) but weight is weight and it feels good. I've eaten clean for two whole days (except for a nip of Brandy last night) and it feels terrific.  Yesterday I rode my bike indoors on the windtrainer for a whole 20 minutes! I can't wear my regular brace when I do that because it only gives my 90deg of movement, and I need about 115 to ride. So I wore the tensor, which seemed to be enough. And I iced it down after.  Today is a weights day. I will get going after I drop the kids off.  Kyle had a friend over yesterday and they spent hours on the computer going to funny links. A couple are great star trek TNG clips. I'll have to try to find them.  LCS

158," Which I already knew, of course, but I am feeling pretty sorry for myself. Three and a half weeks ago I tore ligaments in my left knee, effectively curtailing most fun for the next several months. PMO!!! Anyway - the good news is that the bruising has now faded, the swelling is down, I can walk further than I could even a couple days ago. The bad news is that I am still wearing this silly brace and using a cane. The physiotherapist said I ""did a real number"" on my LCL and illotibial band (sp?) and can expect the healing process to take a while. It could have been worse right? I could have broken my leg or completely torn the LCL. It could have been my right leg and I wouldn't be able to drive.   So much for paddling this summer. At this point I still can't bend my knee far enough to get or out of a boat. I CAN still do weights though and I had a short somewhat successful trial on my indoor bike a couple days ago. I walked around the bloack today too - not exactly the 10km run I wished I was doing, but a few days ago I could only make it halfway around and today the whole loop was easy. Progress, progress.  My plan for tomorrow is to get up and ride my bike (indoors again) after I do my physio exercises.

170," Hi, this blog is an attempt to keep track of my more vivid dreams in order to figure out what the hell is going on in them.
",ND
171," The first dream was that my little brother brought over season three of The Shield on DVD, but it was a poor quality rip from a VCR recording.  The second dream is that I was out on the beach with my brother and he went into the water and pulled out a morray eel and attempted to behead it. He only got down to the last string before he stopped and it was still alive and cleaning it's self like a cat. I was pretty disturbed by this so I begged him to finish the job and just put it out of it's misery. I know this one is in connection to the recent beheadings in the middle east.
",ND
172," Last night, I drempt that a co-worker, Lea, came to my desk to ask what I was listening to for another co-worker. I have no idea what this dream means at all.
",ND
173," Dream 1 - I found another black cat who was just like my old cat Dolemite in most ways, the size, the personality and everything and I wasn't sure if it was him or not, but I was going to keep him. He and Gunther seemed to get along. But all of this occured in my grandparent's old house in MA. I still really miss Dolemite.
",ND
174," I was taking a tour of the white house with my mother and grandmother and my aunt and uncle from that side happened to be there as well as Laura Bush.
",ND
175," after the work i'm doing everyday..i still find the chance to sitback and relax to a hot and not that comfortable room..but slow music in the background. in that hot and not comfortable room, i realize lots of things. like being alone in a valentine's day in my 4-teenage years.  yup, i always say ""i hate valentines day, it's just for the couples who love each other."" ok, it 's a big lie the night i realized it..we should celebrate the valentines day that we really love and care for like our families and true friends. the next time that valentines day will come, i'll invite my whole barkada to have fun.  every entry i publish here would be my feelings and realizations in my hot and not that comfortable room.. :) i hope it can help you to realize things too..
",ND
176," Work was situated between two buildings, a Walgreens and a Safeway supermarket. I was there with a long ex-employee and a new employee (who was kinda a nerd and annoying) and my boss came out of this room, that I had never seen before and was some sort of control room. I have no idea what this means.
",ND
177," i'll be writing what i really feel here in this blog..even iff it's mushy or very corny..you don't care 'coz it's my feeling..
",ND
178," everytime i have a crush, i'm always hoping for something that might not come true. i always end up daydreaming about him, i can't concentrate on the things i'm doing. sometimes, i convience myself that the guy i like might like somebody else, but i still like him.  maybe the word  martyr  is next to my name. i'm always waiting for the right guy but i always falling with the wrong guy. a friend e-mailed me about what those the selection their mean, the question # 8 asked to choose a # between 1-10..i choose 8..and it says thare that's the number i will fall in love before i get married..that's so weird. ok, i admit it..i easily fall in love with a guy that is really sweet,nice, good-looking and accepts me for who i am.. gtg..i've got some work to do..
",ND
179," one of my friends told me that their is a big change to her attitude. i think she changed after what happened tonight. and not only her but all of them. and i'll be honest, i've changed..a lot! honestly, i'm afraid to tell them what i really feel about our friendship. i'm always hidding what i feel, one of my friend told me that  i might comit suicide  if i don't tell anyone the problems i'm keeping to myself. i'll not comit suicide, and i don't want to hurt myself.  anyways, i'll change for the better.
",ND
180," So this is a good idea. There is so much going on in my life...yes, a way to keep track of it is good. Maybe I'll get motivated...we'll see .            So let's start with ""The Diet""...     I started about 6 weeks ago. (I think, I can't remember really.) The start weight was 255, and I made a goal of losing 100 pounds. Ok, so we'll count this as week Six......down to 233. Total lost: 22 pounds.
",ND
181," Ive had this blog for a while and have been working on a new template, self-teaching myself cascading style sheets. Ive decided to keep this pre-designed template provided by blogger.com. I suppose its alright...quite professional looking. I applaud whoever makes these. But my new one will be the shit.   Anyway, I was having a good day today until 3rd period and I had english. We're supposed to be a democracy right? That is the whole point of our country, the American Dream. Well, why is school have such a FASCIST system? They tell us what we have to learn and force us to learn in no matter what. If we dont we are threatened with referrals for insubordination or possibly even suspended. What the fuck is this. I hate public school, alot of teachers just dont care about their students. I know if you're a public school kid you just cant possible fathom how much better a private school like Gilman is and I'm sorry if I offend you. I think Ill stop now...please feel free to leave comments. I'll read them.
",ND
182," Ive been talking to this girl Jessica for a while now, perhaps about 3 months. It has come to the point where we both want to officially start ""seeing"" each other but we lack the dating experience. What I mean by this is that we have only really gone out together twice. So she has decided that she would like to wait. But she didnt tell me this until the day after that she told me that she wanted to finally make it official. This chick seems so high maintenance that it drives me crazy. Lets say that I dont respond to her on the internet for 1 minute or more she thinks I dont want to talk to her or something else is wrong.
",ND
183," So...I didn't lose any weight last week. This is not surprising, being that I had the most bizarre cravings, and thus binged a few times. I didn't gain weight, so I'm not going to complain too much...So still...we're at 233. I dunno what the hell is wrong with me, but I'm actually going to call a doctor. I've got to be hella sick or feel really damn bad to even consider such a thing. But I hurt, I've been up all night, and the shit has got to stop. Drugs...that's what I need.  Bucky. Hehe, what can I say besides that? I absolutely cannot believe the whirlwind of feeling and emotion that has come to me as a result of him. Last weekend was so, so wonderful. I miss him so much. I never, ever intended to fall in love or to let emotion get involved. I mean, how taboo is it to see a married man? However, when the said couple is poly....I mean, why not? He says he can love me and love Megan too, and that he isn't going anywhere. So I'm just going to have fun, enjoy the ride for as long as it lasts, and hopefully, learn from the experiences. Regardless, I love him. It's been a long time since I felt love for a man. It's hard to admit to myself, but I do want him, and to a certain extent, maybe I even think that I need him. There is some connection there that I can't put my finger on. I've no idea what it is...maybe a past life or something.  Anyway, onto the doctor callings I go.
",ND
184," ""...or from him touching me..heh.. :D"" A quote from the girl that I am supposedly talking to and about to go out with's away message. To be honest it has been about 2 weeks since we've seen eachother but a few days before she told me that she wanted to be with me but then she writes shit like this? Is it wrong for me to have an awkward type feeling? I dont think so. Why are you women so god damn complicated? Can't you just tell us the truth instead of making guys like me assume what you're thinking.   Doesnt seem like anyone reads this but I guess it's good for me to relieve tension.
",ND
185," I suppose I should have a little more content to justify the massive, page-lengthening links list at right. (Okay, it's not that massive, but it's longer than the lone post.)  I haven't been thinking about much lately, just doing whatever to get through the day. I haven't been sleeping too well either, for some reason. I sleep through the night but I wake up just as exhausted as the night before. This weekend was nice; I slept quite a bit and lazed around at home. Stress-free. Mom and Grandma are visiting Grandpa in Grand Rapids, so I'm just hanging out online for a few more hours. I should make a shopping list and maybe take Grandpa's van to go shopping. I'd rather wait and go with Matt, but he has to mow the lawn and take care of the trash after he's done with his class. And Grandpa just called and said he's got a prescription to be picked up at the pharmacy before 6pm, so I might as well go by myself.  Thinking about this coming school year, too. I'm so anxious to be done, I just want to get Matt's grad school stuff taken care of and move on with our life. I have one theory class to complete a Communications minor, but it's now cancelled for the Fall semester, which means it will be offered during the Winter semester. If I take it then, it will be alongside the theory class I need for my Literature major, and that would make my brain implode (again). So maybe that was just decided for me. As things stand, this fall I'm taking World Novels (Lit), Western Civilization to 1500 (History), Beginning Latin, French 301, and a morning volleyball class for an even 12 credits. I probably could have handled the theory class this fall, or dropped either Western Civ or Latin and volleyball, but we'll see if it's still cancelled by mid-August. I also need to apply for graduation, but my advisor is out of town this summer, so we'll wait until the Fall semester has started.  It's freezing cold in this house. I wish I'd brought a jacket or a sweatshirt. I suppose I could drive home and get either, but meh. I'll survive.

Why do these online games have to charge? Can't they remain free throughout ur entire life? I would seriously love free P2P games.  Samsung phones are really getting the best of me. I seem to be bored of Samsung phones already. I do not know why. They are basically something like Nokia also. Same phone functions, different name only.

190," Today was Teddy Bear day at Alexander's daycare. All of the kids in his class were supposed to bring Teddy Bears, yesterday they made Teddy Bear books out of construction paper - you get the picture. Alexander does not like to get boxed in to conventional thinking so he interpreted it as ""pet"" day. This opened up his entire stuffed animal collection to be taken to school. Alexander chose his Big Bird to take to school, but it is no ordinary, stuffed, Big Bird. Oh no. This one was given to him as paybacks for some annoying toy that my wife or I gave to someone else's child. This Big Bird has a whole bunch of games that you can choose by squeezing his toes. He also has a backpack full of blocks that have letters, numbers, and shapes. You put a block into his hand and talks about it, depending on which game you picked. Sounds good on paper, right? The catch is that some deviant toy maker endowed this Big Bird with the most annoying, nasal voice - and it has no off switch. That's right. Once you awaken the bird, it starts talking, trying to get the child to play, it waits a few seconds, and then tries again, and again, and again.... Remember how I said that there is no off switch? Yeah. I imagine that the designers of this toy are in a witness protection program somewhere. Think about how this toy got made - in some corporate meeting room, an assortment of marketing, technical, sales, and other people got together - probably many times, reviewed this design, and decided that it was a good idea. Anyway, this is what Alexander took to school. I thought that I had hidden it better than that, but I was mistaken. Anyway, when I took him into his room, his teacher thought that The Bird was cute - and then he awakened it. I chose that moment to beat feet out of there. In the evening when I returned to pick up Alexander, his bird was not in his cubby with his blanket and other things. It was on top of the cabinets as far out of reach as the teachers could make it. They must not like that voice, either.

192," Hello,      I am trying this blog thing for the first time, I kinda like the idea of it... today has started off pretty good, I still have to vacum the house... yesterday was a great day... unfortunatly the voices in my head keep on telling me to do things, things they have never told me to do before... they used to always tell me to kill and to hurt... but now they are trying to help me I think, you see, yesterday I went to the mall with my girlfriend, and we went and saw a movie together. My voices only come out in the dark and it happened to be just dark enough in the theater for me to hear them. Throught the whole movie they were telling me to do stuff like, put my arm around her, kiss her, stuff like that... sometimes it got plain disturbing the things they told me (I won't repeat them...) but overall yesterday was an awesome day... last night though, when I got home, they ""punished"" me for the times that I wouldn't listen to them... they were screaming inside my head that I am worthless, that I have no chance of having a real life if I refuse to listen to them... and last night I had a dream about what it would have been like had I listened to them... I don't know what to do... I think that they are trying to trick me to trusting them so that they can eventually have me do things that I will really regret... but I don't know... also... my girlfriend's ex, Richie (grr... must... kill..), keeps on telling her that she has to break up with me and start talking to him again in order for her to have a chance of getting back into thespians, god, I truly do hate him... he is using things that I can't stand that I said against me now... and it really get's to my girlfriend... god, I love her so frigin much... but I just don't know what to do sometimes... I think, hell, I know she still has feelings for him... but I couldn't confront her about them in a million years... my best friend, kevin, thinks that I should break up with her... but god, i just couldn't bear to do such a thing... well, I'd better go... I've got more to write, I may post again later tonight...

193," It started off as a fine day. Got up early, came to work. As usual, my PC would give me some slight problems, but after a while, it would be okay.  New colleague really giving me lots of headache. Taught him thousand and one things and all he can remember is only 0.01% of everything. This is a real saddening case. Wish that I can just fire him and save my hair from turning all white.  Half hour to lunch. Wonder what's there to eat? Let's hope no more LG1 food. Getting sick and tired of the food there. Making me shirt and etc stink like crazy.  Toothache seriously aching like crazy now. Must see doc. Most probably, whole tooth will have to come out. Damn.  Phones also giving problem. LCD problem. aiii. Why do these LCDs always give humongous problems? Really cannot stand it already. Everytime an LCD fails, it stays in the workshop for dunno how long.  KTMB also another one. Giving problems like nobody's business. Wanna give them busines, they dun wan. Real tired of them already. Called them dunno how long, they dun answer. :( Hope they reply my sms.  After work, had a great time. Jessy called. We just talked about everything and anything. She was at the pasar malam. Then I told her that I'll call her right after she gets back. I did.   We talked and talked and talked for 2 hours and 30 minutes. We are just normal friends. We talked bout unique names for her kids (Zanique, Danielle, Cyclice / Celynn) and she commented a few for me (I Lai, He Lai, She Lai, They Lai, We Lai, It Lai). Both of us were just plain talking. It's hard to find someone that you can click to in just a short while. Plus, we did more than just click. We were close, quite close friends already.  Her boyfriend's coming back tomorrow. She must be really happy. Can tell from the tone on her voice.   Well, that's all for today. See ya.

200," Today I got my Orange belt in Choi Kwang Do. The last ""light"" colored belt before Green which goes into the darker colored belts. I took the pictures tonight of the belt ceremony using my wife's Fuji S2. Sharp camera! Since I am an asst instructor I am now teting every month. I have my patterns down through Green belt, and plan on learning Blue and Purple patterns this week. :)  This weekend I did my first ""non-official"" videography event - a ""reception"" party for a couple that was married in Hawaii several months ago. Luckily it did not rain since it was an outside event. :) I took about 2 hours of film. I would think that a wedding would have actually been easier since there are actual ""events"" that you have to capture. This was basically just a party and therefore I became more the voyeur than the observer like normal weddings in that I had to walk around taping interesting converstaions. Luckily the bride & groom both have very outgoing personalities as do most of their close friends. My wife was the photographer (http://oneclickawayphoto.com) so in some cases I followed her around. But as the night wore on and the drinks became more potent I was able to pull out some interesting stories from some of the key attendees. Though I was really wanting Grandma to participate but she did not like the idea of being taped. Must be a generational thing. :)  Have you ever had a mental image of someone you worked with over long distances, but then when you actually met them or saw their picture realized your image was WAY off base? Had that happen today. Man - talk about being wrong. :)   Anyway - I'm off to play XBox. Later!

202," I just got back from seeing the movie I, Robot starring Will Smith.  Let's just say I was just a tidge disappointed in the movie.  First of all, when I heard that this movie was coming out I picked up the book (not the misleading one with Will Smith on the cover).  I was fascinated by the book in the fact that it was a series of vignettes about the evolution of robots from mindless machines to a species equal to ours, all shown through the eyes of a robot pschoanalyst.  I thought these stories were amazing and saw a definite flow to all the unlinked stories.  This made me very intriqued about how the movie was going to be.     I had read that Alex Proyas was going to take liberties with the plot, but keep Isaac Asimov's vision intact.  I believe he failed, miserably.  What Mr Proyas made was just another unbelievable action movie that appeal to the dense overly stimulated action freak with none of the intended vision to what he speaks of.  It is sad really there was so much emotion and cerebral moments that were lots in the mindless CGI and laws of physics bending fight sequences that have been over used by ever movie since the first Matrix.  In fact they should have called this a Matrix prequal that George Lucas would have been proud of (including the apparently useless sidekick kid from Even Stevens that didn't have to do with anything in the story except a cheap laugh, can you say JAR-JAR).       There was some redeeming value, there was some witty dialogue that kept the plot interesting.  But of course, like all Will Smith movies, there was far too many pointless one-liners.   Another point was the fact that the leading lady wasn't just some no brain supermodel which was hard to believe that she actually could read the script (Denise Richards in The World is Not Enough), but they found some one less than perfect who was actually believable though still too young to be a brilliant scientist.       Overall the movie was entertaining, but not something that Asimov would have been proud to go see.

I dunno that jes pisses me off he has no right to ask for any kind of compensation after that. He took the money out of me in physical pain as well as hospital bills and the pure fact that he could be owing me money a whole lot quicker with one call to the cops. Dennis sit back, realize how cool about this I've been and give me a motherfucking break. Im still paying goddamn court fees from before and I dont have a fucking job so just accept me being cool and what you did payment enough. Whatever s'bullshit. So neways on a different note...I was glad I got to talk to Sarah last night, I feel bad tho because I can't help but feel bad for being the person who came between her and Tina. Todays just a generally bad day and all I can hope for is for it to start going better....sometime....

I dunno...I haven't been going out with Sarah long and I don't know her very well, but I feel like its always gonna stay that way. We never seem to spend more than a half an hour--tops together and theres never any conversation. I wish we could talk or see each other but maybe shes just too busy...Guess I'll just have to wait for that one day when I call shes home or she calls me to see her...that one day...somewhere down the road. I came home early tonight to do some make-up work and Im glad to say I at least got some done so hopefully I can pass grammer, I don't know about ICA though those essays seem to be amongst the missing. Well going back to my bed and the one thing I can always count on to be comforting...sleep.

210," OMG it is so hot and humid! Today was this || close to being absolutely horrible, but there was one saving grace, and I'll save that for the end of this post. So, today I realized the full extent of the work I have to do (and should be doing now, but its too fucking HOT to stay focused) and have not done. All of my classes where boring as hell, History was the usual blend of note taking and sitting around with nothing to do, but today it was like a sauna (this is not good). I skipped Chem. to go have lunch with Tegan, which was really fun ;-), this would be the saving grace I mentioned. After finally saying ""bye"" to her *sigh*, I booked it back to Elmira to make it to class only about 5 min late for Physics. Again it was like a sauna in that class, even with the windows open, and we watched a movie and worked on the project I left at home in my rush to meet Tegan on time. So effectively did nothing. English was the same except the whole class didn't do any work, even Mr. Miessner didn't seem like he wanted to do work so he just let us talk all class. That class was productive, gossip wise, because I found out some interesting things about Chadder's ex. which I found quite funny.  Verdict: day as a whole sucked serious ass, but there where a few good times (thanks Tegan)

212," I went over to my brother's yesterday evening to give him a demo of Knoppix. It was a CD which I got with my Dutch magazine PC-Active. The version is 3.3 His impression before putting the CD in was that Linux was overall much to difficult to learn, after all, he'd been using Windows since he has a PC - which is a fair few years now. When the KDE desktop appeared with working sound his face simply lit up. He didn't have to say anything, I could hear him think ""wow!"". We had a look through the main menu-structure and just ran a few programs - Mozilla, KMail, KStars, the Control Centre. He was simply impressed. I have to say, even from the CD, Knoppix is fast and reliable. He's now going to play around with the CD for a while and will probably get more enthousiastic as time goes by. In a couple of weeks (days?), I expect a request to make him a permament install on his hard-drive. He had just had a lot of virus-related problems and his windows-box had grind to a halt a couple of days ago. He was very interested in learning that with this operating system, no more of that would happen. He was also worried he wouldn't be able to do the things in Linux he did under Windows, but after showing him OpenOffice.org, this was no longer an issue.  Oh, by the way, there is a new version of Knoppix, 3.4 - read all about it on the  urlLink Knoppix website

215," You lil' ass! I told you not to tell Dest what I had said! Now she hates me more than before, oh well i guess. I can't be angry, no matter how hard i try i can't do it. Well, not at least since me and Abie got together. (Abie, if you are reading this, I love you, Baby!) The only thing I can be is happy . . . Is that a good thing?!? If not it sure feels like it! Garrett, I may not be angry with you, but I'll still kick your ass, you lil' bitch! Now I know i can't tell you anything, without it being repeated! That's depressing, or it would be if I wasn't thinking about Abie . . .

216," Someone finally told Dest how they really felt other than me, that makes me so incredibly happy! I’m not sure who said it, but Lydia had something to add to it. She said to Dest, “You’re a sweet girl, you just need to shut your fucking mouth!” Garrett, I’m sorry that I’m saying all this, but this is how I really feel. Dest made me sooo damn mad today; she was talking about how she hates when people talk bad about other people behind their bavks, but she was doing the same damn thing to Michelle. And Michelle is the last damn person I would stand up for, but Dest pissed me off sooo fucking bad! All I hate to say when I walked into the RamPage office was HYPOCRITE and Dod so completely agreed with me. I know I’m a hypocrite, but if I ever get as bad as Dest I hope someone tells me or knocks the hell out of me, one or the other!

218," OK. I've been wanting to blog for awhile. Thing is I can't decide how honest I want to be in it. What if someone in the family found it? Guess I'll just have to take that chance. So anyway, what I really wanted to write about is Shana. I hate talking to anyone in the family about her because I don't want to upset them. I mean, what if they're having a good day? Then I pour out all of my stuff and make them start grieving again. Although I know, realistically, that we'll never stop grieving. I still cannot believe that she killed herself. Immediately after, that week, sometimes someone would say it must have been an accident. But come on, Shana was brilliant. She knew how little she was. Taking a bottle of anti-depressants and pain pills was not an accident. She wanted to leave. She wanted the pain to stop. That's why she took them at bedtime.  I still hear my brother describing how he found her. Right after we got to the house he told us everything. Took us up to Shana's room and showed us her bed. Showed us where he carried her to the top of stairs and tried CPR. Told us the police had to pry her out of his arms. Told us she was already getting stiff. And she was cold, he said, so cold. Sometimes I can't stop hearing the stuff from that week. I can hear him crying my name.  I remember so much from that week. Picking out the fingernail polish, helping Grandma iron her clothes. Previewing her hair and makeup with my sisters. We took a picture for reference. My sister was so tough. I couldn't see the details through the tears but J did.  Even writing in my journal I feel like I need to edit stuff out. But I can't. It's time to get this stuff out. Shana's been gone for over a year and I still don't really believe it. She was only 19 and had so much to live for. I'll never stop wondering why.  Her suicide note was in her live journal. Titled ""Enough is Enough"". That's it. I'm done. I love you all... The same message, or maybe a little longer, was set up as an 'away' message in outlook. I never could bring myself to email her so I'd get it back as a reply. I asked my sister if she'd made up an album of Shana stuff. She said she thought the pictures belonged interspersed with other family pictures. I don't know though. Seems like I might do an album - but do I put the funeral notice and program in there too? I wanted to keep them. Don't know why.

222," So I didn't get around to posting more earlier as I expected....I'll get better.  I'm now over halfway done with my marathon summer semester.  I never took Physics in high school.  Not sure how I passed Chemistry my junior year.  But, for now, I'm doing well in Physiology.  I'm loving it!  Science is cool.  I spent the last 20+ years fearing references to science and now I want to go out of my way to read or watch them.    Admittedly I have changed over the past year or so.  A life crisis (as opposed to a mid-life crisis which I am not old enough to have yet) let me to decide I want to go into nursing.  To do that I have to plunge into science.  Now I find its not bad.  Where did I get the impression it was?  The larger question in my mind is what happens in our schools that so many children and teens like myself end up hating science?  Can something be done to change that.  Everyone has different interests; be they theater, media, science, athletic or something else.  However, shouldn't our schools foster at least an interest or respect for all areas?  With obesity increasingly an issue athletics are important.  Science technology is equally important.  What would life be without music or theater?  In the rush to standardize test I think we are missing the large point problem.  It is that kids should enjoy school.  We have all had good teachers who make learning fun.  As a society we need to study those teachers and start pushing for more like them.

223," I was recently watching one of my favourite movies, the wizard of Oz and i realized that you can only move on if you learn that dreams don't necesseraly come true, that pain don't necesseraly pass by and that you have to lock your dreams and your hopes somewhere deep in your soul. It is hard to find out that you will not be necesseray happy, you will not find someone who loves you the way you love him. But it doesn't matter, you learn to come along, you learn to get tougher and tougher. I'm afraid, afraid of waking me up one day and find out that i'm feeling anything.

Well thats what I did.   I came back last week at the end of the day and Jim started on  me about something that was of no big deal but I blew up and started  yelling at him and him at me and the next thing I know I quit.  I stormed out of the office and went home. It hit me what I had  just done about half way home.  I knew I was wrong in geting mad and quiting but what was done was done. I went home and told my wife and she didn't say a word.

It was a good time to move on so it was no big deal.  Me and the owner seem to hit heads a lot but it also happens with the other guys too.  Jim (owner) is not the easiest person to get along with.  At the beginning of the day Jim gives us a route sheet with all the informsation about the Equipment  we need for the day and a list and addresses of the jobs and who we are working with and the truck  we will take.  Most of the time he has to remember who won't work together that week because of arguments we  have had the last few days. It's not easy doing his job most of the time.

226," France and the Allies celebrated last week end one of the most fantastic military operations ever made in the world. Never so much depended on so few courageous soldiers wo sacrified to free a continent they didn't know. I'm 26 and i knom i'm living in a free land thanks to brave young men who fought for what they believe to be right. I will always love this America but i can help thinking that today America is on the wrong way. America's grief is justified, America is right to launch attacks against a faceless ennemy who wants to burn the whole world but this fight can be boiled down to a fight between evil and good, to a crusade against barbarians, it will be dangerous and counterproductive. Europe knows how complex is the world, europe knows how high is the price of blood and Europe doesn't want to be part of the wrong war. The United States are our closest friends and friends don't have to agree on everything. On the contrary, i will be happy if my friends tell me that i'm about to make a huge mistakes, that i act like a fool. I will be very thankful and i will accept this lend hand... because i don't want to stumble and fall in the Depths

Well, not really, but I did call most of my close friends and family. (If you're reading this and wondering why I didn't call you...get over it.) Commencement went well, except for the part where I got the case with no diploma inside!:) The weekend was great, except for when I found out that I had to change my living arrangments because of someone backing out of a contract. I won't name names, but his initials are Tim Taylor.. (No hard feelings Tim :))Only four more weeks of college, and then I'll become as close to democrat as possible so that I can freeload off of society and milk the government for all it's worth until I finally land a job. At this point, any chance of actually landing a journalism job seems about as realistic as bumping into Tom Hanks at Merritt Square Mall. (I'd say more like...one in a million.'- 'So you're telling me there's a chance!'- Dumb & Dumber) Speaking of Merritt Square, the new theater there is amazing. As my good bud Stacey said, the theater's motto should be: Cobb 16- ""Can you believe you're in Merritt Island?"". We saw day after tommorow and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be and they didn't really push an agenda like all the media was saying they would. That's truly a first!

I should get doing the research now, because it'll take awhile, but I have other, more pressing matters, like writing in my blog, vacuuming my room, changing my cat's litter, all that good stuff. And finding my remote. I was watching one of the newschannels, and the news guy was interviewing this woman on the recent phenomenon in America of organization, with shows like Clean Sweep, and stuff, and she was talking about how people spend a certain amount of time everyday looking for something when they could be doing something that they really want to do, and while she was saying that, I was desperately looking for my remote.

Someone forgot to informs me that the water temperature drops as you live further up North and that the Pacific Ocean isn't nearly as balmy as the Atlantic. Duh.  Uh, and can we please talk about the fog? Horrid little overcast that can last for hours on end. It's the coast! It's suppose to be sunny. Was Baywatch a lie?

235," Living in California I discovered a wonderful sport - Rugby. I know, I know what you must be thinking. Extreme pain. Trust me, the way girls play, it's not painful. It's like tackle football with the guys back in the South. If you don't want to land on the ground, just find somebody and land on them.  I can run pretty fast, so I'm a center (in a full squad of Rugby I play outside Center). Summer 7's (that's 7 minute halves, with 7 players on a full field) is geared for the backs and I absolutely love it! It's the closest I'll come to playing contact football, without the protection (mouth guard is it baby).  I play with some of the girls on the San Jose State team. They are a bit whacked (yes, Virg, I'm talking about you, and you Kelly). Last year on Thursday nights we'd practice on the beach then head over to the Beach Boardwalk and ride the roller coaster (and while most people hung on to the safety bar, Virg hung onto her breast, to each their own, I guess, Virg you little freak).   So far, on our first tourney we won all three games. I was unable to play because I popped a blood vessel in my eye.  I know what you are thinking - Ew.   Trust me, I ran for my phone so fast to call my eye doctor, Holy Toledo. I wasn't in pain, just had this HUGE bubble of blood in my eyeball, well, that's gone but there is a sea of blood around my eye now.  Of course I now go around freakin' everyone out. My rugger mates told me to come up with a creative story, that taking my contact out wasn't good enough... so here goes:  Two guys, one small room, very little time...

236," Now that it's the middle of July, and my best friend is in California for the entire month, and my computer doesn't have internet, I feel really strange. It's like lonely, but not necessarily bored. Last week I rented Prince of Persia: Sands of Time for my Gamecube, and even kept the game past its due date  to finish it, it was that good. So I'm not necessarily bored. Like tonight, for instance, I finished 'Lucky', by Eddie de Oliveira (he's cute). It was a really good book, and I'm glad I read it. However, now that the game is played, and the book is read, I seriously need something more to do. I hoped to have a job by now, but then, I had also hoped to be going on student exchange this autumn, but it's amazing how, no matter how hard you try, some plans just refuse to come to fruition.

240," Ever notice how the end of the school year is both exhilarating and a real let down? I spend an entire year teaching students to be better thinkers, writers, and people, yet only some of this shows through. Your high achievers get better, some of your middle achievers improve, and a lot of students just stay the same.  Behavior is at an all time low at this point too. Since my fifth graders don't have finals, thye've been tuning me out for the last three weeks. It's terrible. Although there is little I can do about it, I just hope that something of the knowledge and behavior skills that I taught remain with them. Maybe my modeling good behavior might just rub off on them in the long run. Who knows? Anyway, it has been a long year and I am ready for it to end. Thank God it ends next week!

My girlfriend and I just had a very important discussion two weeks ago about getting married. She then left to go on vacation for two weeks with her family. Since she leff, I keep thinking that she will say she doesn't love me and doesn't want to marry me. I've told her I love her and that I want to marry her but haven't yet proposed.      She is the type that likes to know all about what's going to happen before it happens. So she asked me all about the future and what I think about when we should get married and what will happen after that. I told her I want to marry her in December. She objects because she is a school teacher (like me)and that is a busy time of year. I'm okay with doing it another time (like June) but I love her so much and want to begin my life with her right now.      Anyway, I'm ultimately worried that she will get scared and run away. But I'm probably being stupid and untrusting. She cares very much for me and I know that for sure, so I should just be content with that.

I believe that they all need to have their OWN homes where they are special. To me they are all special. It can be very hard to make all the cats  feel  special and I do try to make them feel that way. I don't like to see them broken hearted when a new one arrives. That causes me stress. Sometimes new arrivals require alot of attention and the other cats get their feelings hurt and start to shy away. That breaks my heart too. Plain fact is that I need help. I need foster parents to take in orphaned babies so they can be adopted. At work we get so many calls of people finding orphaned kittens and the shelters here are full. I can't take them because my sancutary cats have been exposed to FIP. If they come here they have to stay forever. I already found 5 orphaned kittens myself. I had no where to send them so now they are here to stay. Anyone out there want to help bottle feed babies? If you do and live in Pensacola, FL call me: 261-0760 or 492-6878. I will start a list and give notice at work that I have foster families! That would be too cool! Those of us that work in a Vet Office, we are there because we LOVE what we do and we LOVE animals.

252," this is the first time i ever done one of these, it seems a little awkard for me considering i'm such a shy person  But i feel its something that i need, no one listens anymore.  Its like there deaf to everything i say, i'm going unheard....its a really painful feeling.  i heard a song today by story of the year, ""anthem to out dying day"", it was a song that appealed to me in no sort of reason, but i still felt compelled to do something.  i have listened to it non-stop for about 2 hours and it still hasn't gotten old for me.  Its a new one for me considering i like songs for about a week then never listen it for awhile.  i don't know what but it appeals to something in my life, something i've been wanting for awhile.....her. she is one of the most perfect people i have ever seen i my life. She lights up my entire life when ever i am near her.  its like nothing i've ever felt, and it aches...because i can't tell her how it feels...how will she react?  she is the type of person that isn't very open...like me.....i can't just tell her ""hey i love you baby!""  that just won't cut it, for me and for her.  It seems like she wants something more in a relationship, something i'm trying to find and seem to have found, but can't tell her.  Will she reject or rejoice?  I know it seems like a cliche type of love story but that is just the way this story is.  I wish she would just run into to my arms and say, i love you and nothing is never going to change that.  My heart grows heavy when i see her with other people...other men...i always feel like my window is closing to her..like i'll miss my shot..and i will....i just can't do anything about it.  I won't too, but i just can't.  I don't want to ruin what we already have.  I keep thinking that she will freak out and our relationship will never be the same with her.  Its a solitary confinement for me.  No windows, only a door, which i'm afraid to open, afraid to see whats on the other said.  Something lies beyond the door that i want too see, but i am afraid too...what happens if disater lurks beyond the door...

Well last night I drove home and as it was so sunny I decided to take some pictures of my building to show my Grandma when I next go home.  I rang my Grandma and my sister Sindy.  I have agreed to move in with my sister next year and her boyfriend Art, if I don’t they will have to move.  Their house is really nice, plenty big enough and it would be wonderful living in London.  Plus I think I will feel more ‘settled’ down there.  It would be good for Art too as he will be able to use my car.  I don’t have a job lined up but I have my long term plan sorted:  Temp/bar work and apply for proper jobs, if I don’t get proper job by January, apply for teacher training.  It’ll be fine…..  Last night I also worked on a website for work a little bit and then watched TV.  My house is a tip so tonight I think tonight I will do lots of cleaning and tidying.  I have an interview on Friday for which I should really be revising, but you know, tidying’s better than revising (ask any student!!)  Well today the sun came out again bright and hot.  It’s sad being stuck in an office on a day like this.  I’d love to be stretched out, outside with a book.  Ho hum.

Put off many appointments because of my anxiety. Wish me luck ",D
263,"Writing out my feelings in hopes of gaining some sense of catharsis
I'd like to start by saying I don't think I'm a danger to myself. I'm tethered here pretty strongly by my family and my best friend. I can't see myself leaving them, because I've seen what it does to people when those closest to them go. I resent the fact that I can't go, at times, but there's nothing to be done about it really. 

Most of the people in my life only ever knew my outer shell. The somewhat false personality that I put on in order to function. Over the last three years my mask has been crumbling away and the results haven't been pretty. It's been a viscous feedback loop that leaves me feeling worse and worse as people fall out of my life one by one, either by their own choosing or because I distance myself to hide my pain as I become less and less able to handle it. 

The summer after my sophomore year I was in the darkest place of my life. I had to pull out of university and move home to get therapy. It was actually very effective, and my junior year was a home run. I was getting the highest test scores in STEM classes with 600 students, I was killing it in my philanthropic efforts, and I had more friends and social obligations than I knew what to do with. 

My senior year I spent the fall studying abroad in France. It was magical. I fell in love for the first time. I wasn't reciprocated, but the thing I learned about love is that it doesn't have to be reciprocated to be the most beautiful thing you've ever felt. 

When I got back from France, the seeds of my current ruin were planted. All throughout college I'd been heavily involved with a camp for kids whose parents have cancer. I did it because my dad had cancer when I was a little kid, and the people I met were all wonderful, but most of all because the only thing that gives me a sense of purpose is helping other people. It drives almost everything I do. This camp gave me a rock that I could cling to through the worst of my emotional storms. 

The two directors of the camp were both new my senior year. While I was in France, one of them dropped out of school due to her own struggles with mental health. The director that was left over was completely overwhelmed, and entirely ineffectual. People left and right were telling me that I should take the open position. I didn't want it; I have ADHD as well as depression and I was so anxious about my lack of organization. Camp was in such a hole though, and for the sake of my friends and my campers and their families I did the only thing I felt like I could do, and took on the directorship. 

It was rough. My co-director continued to do little of anything, and I felt like I was juggling grenades. I couldn't fuck this up. Kids I'd been mentoring for years needed this camp to cope in a healthy way, and for a number of parent couples, the week of camp was the last time they got to spend alone together before one of them would pass away from cancer. 

My grades dropped a whole point, on average. My volunteer research suffered, and I really let down the post doc I was assisting (Sorry Bethany). My mental health took a nosedive as well.  

I made camp happen. It was ugly and bumpy and unorganized, but I made it happen. I took solace in the fact that the kids didn't seem to notice the flaws, but it didn't do a lot good for my relationships with the other volunteers. 

I redoubled my efforts at the beginning of my 5th and final year of college. I moved into a house with some of the other volunteers who I was closest to. I had to quit my research, and I couldn't keep my grades where I wanted them, but camp planning was progressing well, especially after our national organization took notice of the lack of effort on my co-director's part and added a third director, my friend and newly minted roommate A.  

A helped enormously, but I still had so much on my plate. To cope with the stress, my drug use started to skyrocket. I was smoking weed and cigarettes all the time, and to keep up with all my biochemistry coursework and 8-10 planning meetings a week I was taking my prescribed adderall more often than I should have been. I became thoroughly addicted. In my final quarter of school, everything really fell apart. 

I was completely overwhelmed, and became less and less effective at my job. I put A in the exact position that I had been in the previous year. I could feel him resent me more and more every day, but I was too ashamed to talk to him about it, and he never asked me how I was doing. 

I barely graduated. As soon as school was over I quit adderall cold turkey, because it had been putting me in a very dangerous mental headspace for weeks, but until then it had remained a necessity. The withdrawals hit me like a truck. Getting out of bed felt like a truly herculean task. I was an empty husk of a human being and from graduation to camp in August I contributed almost nothing to the camp. I had nothing left to give. 

A hated me by that point. He began to tell people what he thought of me, and they listened. I watched helplessly as some of my closest friends and roommates began to look down upon me, if not for what A was saying then for my severely depressed behavior. I couldn't even really blame them. After camp, when we had our traditional fun awards ceremony, A was awarded ""Most likely to make camp happen by himself"". I was awarded ""Linger"", a camp song I was known for singing, but also a very pointed jab. It was humiliating. 
At the afterparty that night I drunkenly told A everything. He said it was ok, and I cried lying drunk on the porch.

I lived in the house with him for a few more months while I looked for a job. A was incredibly distant, and became more and more hostile over time. I got a job on a crab boat. I had a few reasons for doing it, but the most important reason in my head was that I might be lucky enough for it to kill me. The day I moved out A sent me a 6 paragraph essay over text, detailing everything I'd ever done that had disappointed him, and letting me know that there was nothing I could ever do to win his respect back. 

I left the state to work on the crab boat. For 5 months I lived in isolation, either working or chain smoking weed to keep myself from ruminating on all my failures. The crab boat did almost kill me. Multiple times, in fact. In the end I quit, not because I was suddenly afraid to die, but because my captain was the most sadistic piece of human scum I'd ever met, and I couldn't take him any more. 

I've spent the 5 months since then trying to find a job. 50+ apps out and I'm no closer than when I started. I've been up to visit the city I graduated in twice, but both times I've been wracked with crippling anxiety. I can tell how A affected the opinions of some of my closest friends, and it kills me. 

So, that's where I am. I'm going to go smoke a cigarette and pray that I get my dad's cancer even younger than he did. ",D
264,"A song of fire and ice
Hey everyone. I'm on mobile so pardon my typos which will happen. I'd like to take this time to thank anyone who reads this as well as giving a shout out to anyone currently struggling with depression. I have a long history with Type 1 Bipolar Disorder. Although that isn't necessarily depression in itself patients who are Bipolar are bound to eventually oscillate into that emotional polarity.


To give a quick summary here is what happened to me: I grew up incredibly wealthy. My Father was an ex alcoholic. My Mother died when I was 13 and my Father went back to drinking to cope with the loss of his wife (my Mother). My Father became suicidal and threw everything we had away. We went bankrupt and I went to live with my Brother across the country.


My Brothers wife left him shortly after I moved in. He became suicidal as well, ended up hospitalized. I moved back across the country again to live with my then pseudo homeless Father.


One day my Father shows up to my school drunk, gets arrested, I am taken in by the state and put into foster care. I end up living with an incredibly poor hispanic family and eat almost nothing everyday. I have no bed. I sleep on the floor. 


The state then places me in an incredibly religious home where i essentially become a slave and i cook and clean nonstop for an extremely wealthy catholic couple. They don't like me Because I liked hard rock. 


My third stay I end up living in a small apartment with a woman who was good at hiding her side prostitution gig and methamphetamine addiction.


After all the years my Father gets his life back under control. He begins dating a wealthy woman who isn't a fan of me. He takes prolonged stays at her home about 40 miles away. He would visit the house to restock it with food, pay the bills, then leave again. During this time i saw my Father maybe 15 times a year. Each encounter was brief and lasted less than 30 minutes.


During this I still went to school, cooked, did my laundry, and did kind of normal kid stuff.


The point of this story is I am an adult now who is married. I am a software engineer. I am financially stable. Regardless of how dark it gets it is possible to make it out on top. You have to focus and be strong. Do whatever you need to do to survive.


If anyone has any questions or would like to chat, need advice, whatever please let me know. I currently do volunteer work to aid people who suffer from Bipolar Disorder as well as others like ADHD or OCD. I also, accidentally, mentor Fatherless children on Xbox Live (strange, I know).

 Any thoughts on what I should do?",D
267,"Cold turkey of Escitalopram
So let me begin this by saying this is a terrible idea and I should definitely taper off with the help of my psychiatrist.

So, earlier this year after some lack of focus and insistent lethargy eventually my parents decided to take me to a psychiatrist. One thing leads to another and I am diagnosed with depression and put on a dose of escitalopram (generic form of Lexapro) 20mg a day. Have a history of depression on my mother's side, and they had all the symptoms pretty severely minus the suicidal ideation, which I believed supported their diagnosis.

So as school was finishing up and I had exams to study for, I spent most afternoons essentially consciously unconscious as I was too tired and struggling to keep a focus on homework and related tasks. Long story short told my parents I had been taking Adderall once and a while and we talked to the psychiatrist and he was very understanding and after trying to allow the SSRI to do its magic, he ultimately added an Adderall script to my regime.

So for some months I took the addy as needed and the anti-depressant as described (other than the days I forgot). So fast forward to summer and while I'm feeling marginally better, I was lead to believe the addy was doing most of the work. 

So just last week I decided just to cold turkey the SSRI. Now, this was a slight test of seeing how I would react to abstaining from the meds (which is an awful idea). Strangely, I have noticed no real change whatsoever from when I was taking it to this past week of not taking it at all.

I am somewhat familiar with the omens regarding stopping an anti-depressant cold turkey and the associated rebound depression and serotonin-related issues, however, I am unsure why I haven't experienced anything. The optimistic side of me wants to explain this as my body just being weird and being able to withstand this drug-related anomaly. The pessimistic side of me believes that it's related to escitalopram somewhat length half-life and that a nightmarish hell awaits me very soon.

Just as a side note, at the same time as my depression diagnosis, I also got a blood test which delivered wonderful news that I had Lyme's Disease (which after much reading, I found exhibits many traits of depression and ADHD like disorders) and was promptly treated. Now I don't proclaim to be healed as I still exhibit a sense of lethargy, however, that might just be something I've become accustomed to and given getting out of my house, I am usually able to go out and be alive.

Obviously, not discussing this decision with my doctor is unnecessarily dangerous and naive, but I just don't enjoy taking the medication and this past week kind of supports my idea that I don't really need to take the medication if I am able to function fine without it.

Forgive me for this whole backstory of my last year, I just was unsure if some of this information might be useful in determining what's happening.

**tl;dr**: got lethargic and lacked focus this last year, diagnosed with depression and Lyme's disease, been on escitalopram since spring and Adderall (whenever I choose to take it) since mid-Mayish.

Have stopped taking escitalopram for about a week now and am not exhibiting any withdrawals or issues regarding the cold turkey. My question is: am I an anomaly or am I due for a bitter time in the near future? 

QUICK EDIT: just wanna say I tried looking up this lack of side effects from cold turkey, but all I can seem to find is the side-effects of not taking the medication, so if someone has some website or anecdotal experience they can refer me to, that would be much appreciated :)",D

I went inside the house and asked my mom about the guests, she told me that she intentially lied to me because she wanted me to come over and knew that I wasn’t going to come over if there were guests there. 


I freaked out. My mom completely disrespected my boundaries and said the equivalent of “fuck your social anxiety, do what I want”


I quickly left the house and went back into my car. I wanted to leave there because I knew I couldn’t handle socializing with other people. However, my mom followed me back into my car and started to ask why I was leaving. I tell her that she lied to me and I can’t take deal with my social anxiety. She says she doesn’t believe my social anxiety is real (mind you, I’ve spent two month in a psychiatric hospital last year) and says she wants me to stay. I tell her fuck off and get out of my car but she doesn’t leave.


At this point I don’t know what to do so I freak out. We have an argument for an hour. She’s not leaving my car and is yelling at me. We eventually decide that I should go to my sisters house to sleep. 



I leave but now I have so much anxiety that I can’t drive. I park my car in a nearby parking lot deciding what I want to do. I have so much anxiety at this point that I made a post of /r/suicidewatch but quickly deleted it. 


Then my mom calls me and eventually asks me if I am driving to my sisters house. I don’t respond to the question because I don’t want to lie, and she finds out that Icwas nearby. 


She freaks out. She accuses me of lying to her when I didn’t lie. She then takes her car and starts to find where I was. She finds me and then we have an argument for two hours. She keeps on yelling at me saying that I should come back to the house and “forget about my anxiety”. I tell her I wanted to go back to the psychiatric ward in the hospital and she says that I’m being fucking ridiculous and should stop thinking like this. 


She eventually leaves my car saying that I should come sleep in her house and that “everything will be fine”. Right now it’s 2am and I’m still in my car and I’m so fucking mentally fucked up I don’t know what to do.",D
280,"Am I depressed or just self-pitying?
I don't really understand what counts as depression but I've had no motivation to really do anything since as long as I can remember. Sometimes I get a burst of motivation and try to do something but I give up really easily. It's really easy to say that I'm depressed as an excuse for the way I feel but I'm still able to function so I don't think I can say I am. I still shower, eat, go to work, even the gym sometimes.
I'm not really close with my family, I rarely talk to them and its only when they talk to me and I'm okay with that since I don't really feel like I want to or could hold a conversation with them. Friends I have, I hang out with them sometimes but half the time it feels like a lot of work. I have a girlfriend and I cling to her so hard because I'm so happy when I'm with her and when I'm not with her I'm always thinking of her and get sad that I'm not with her. She recently told me that the way I think of relationships is immature and she cant offer that much time to me since she has other friends who need her too and get mad at her for not soending enough time with them. I can't let go of the way I think relatiomships should be and I want her to reciprocate even if I know it's irrational and I don't feel like anything else in life is really worth living for. I'm not suicidal though, there's a few times it crossed my mind but I always think about how I wouldn't really ever do it or start regretting it while thinking about it because what if things do get better? Other times I feel like going to sleep one night and not waking up would be nice though.",D

Today is my 45th birthday.
Being 45 doesn't bug me as much as the lack of accomplishments and life lived in those years.
I've spent the last 20 years lost in depression.
I'm tired, hopeless, ashamed, and emotionally defeated.
I go to bed scared and wake up disappointed.
People ask if I am suicidal, and my answer is, ""I'm open to the possibility.""
People ask if I'm planning, and I say, ""No, not actively. I've already planned it out.""

282,"Feeling trapped in my head
First off I'm Autistic, I'm studying at Oxford I'm struggling to remember anything, like anything at all, people, faces, dates, facts, etc. I'm feeling more and more alone because I don't feel like I have anything good to think about. I have a girlfriend, she's in the forces and has a lot of structure and meaning to her life and I like that but I see my life as completely pointless.  

So about a year I was cycling in the dark and I was hit by a car, I flew over the bonnet and hit my head. I was out for about half an hour, till I regained conscience in the back of an ambulance, and the crews were cutting off my clothes and pumping me full of morphine. Before this accident I had a very good memory, and my parent would say I could talk about anything that had happened from when I was a child. I was having some weird relationships at the time with different people, and I only came out to them after I was in hospital for a month after the accident, I didn't want to say anything because I didn't want to worry them. I valued their feeling more over my own life, and I still do that now with other people. 

Things started to crash after the accident, I lost people really good friends and I knew it was me, and I changed and something during that accident had altered me, and I hated it. I started to forget people very quickly and events that had happened and horribly people who had died and continuously not realising they had died. That upset a lot of people. Before everything happened I had broken up with a girl (but i didn't realise that after), now I can't remember what we did together or even how we met, but I can't get the thought of her out my head, she later told me to leave never come back, which I did. But even now I still have the feeling of thought of her, and I'm struggling to get rid of that, I don't love her and I'm not in love her, I just feel like i'm obsessed with her a person I know nothing about and It haunts me. 

I've been to a few separate doctors and have been recommended medication, which I believe it has just made it worse. I've talk to my parents but they just talk highly of the pro's of medication and councillors. Hate councillors. (I always ended up lying to them) 

Since everything I've had some real down point, and made two attempts, by failed due to people walking in randomly either whilst in progress or while setting up. I've already made necessary precautions by writing letters, addressing them and stamping them but non have been sent. I want to tell my gf but I feel like, I don't want to throw feelings away by her thinking 'he's a sobbing kid, or he's crazy or why am I with him' - I'd rather hide it not to upset her, people mean everything in the world to me, and I'd give my life for her, any day. But I still want to tell her, and I don't her to be scared of me. 

When I close my eyes and think of a memory, I just see grey mist or static like of a television. It doesn't feel nice not having anything to fall back on in your mind, things that made you happy. ",D
283,"Am I the only one who believes in fantasies and lies to cope with not killing myself?
I believe that one day, the girl I like will like me back. I believe that she will reconsider rejecting me, and apologize to me and we can be in a relationship as more than good friends.

I believe that I will be prepared for my career when I leave college. I believe that I will find an internship this summer and every summer after that. I believe that I will impress employers with my fantastic resume.

I believe that I will make lots of good everlasting friends in college and that I will make even more friends at my workplace in the next three years. The relationships with my high school friends will only strengthen and we will be a group for decades to come. I believe all of the people I know now.

I believe that I will graduate in the next three years, and that I will be able to get As in my classes to increase my GPA. I believe I can graduate with honors, I believe that I will have enough money saved to actually visit Japan.

I believe all of these things because I know I'm a failure at life, and I know I'm not ""built"" to survive and dwell in this world. One day, I will end my life just when my fantasies can no longer be maintained.",D

286,"People I love keep dying. I can't take it anymore.
On New Year's Eve I got a phone call at 1 in the morning that one of my closest friends died. I didn't believe it. I thought it was a joke. It wasn't. His brother made a post on Facebook letting everyone know. It felt like a bad dream.

I couldn't stop crying. I cried at work. I tried to get time off, but they didn't offer bereavement for people who weren't immediate family.

I was so distraught that I couldn't go to the funeral. I was afraid to see his body. I hate myself for being so weak. He was 28. It shouldn't be. He should still be alive.

Four months later, my grandfather died. We were close. The last time we talked he said ""that's my sweetheart, that's my pride and joy."" I sat with him in the hospital and watched Aubrey Hepburn. We promised to see each other again soon.

I saw him a week later in hospice. He was catatonic. I told him it was okay to let go, okay to move on if he was in pain. They say hearing is the final sense to go. He died thirty minutes after I left.

On July 1st my mother told me that she's been diagnosed with cancer. They took a biopsy of her lymph node yesterday to see if it has spread there. She is on a month of leave from work.

That was the final straw for me, I think. I feel like a shell of who I was before December 31st. I am terrified of the future. I remember when my friend died, I asked myself who I would lose next. I had no idea things would spiral down and down.

Everyday is a struggle for me to stay at work. All I want to do is sleep. I have constant migraines (a chronic condition), and the pain paired with the grief is absolute hell. I started seeing a counselor about a month ago, and I like her but she can only do so much. I am on medication, and I have a good support system. 

But the sorrow is just overwhelming. I feel like this grief is never going to end. I wasn't ready to say goodbye to them. I don't want to lose my mom. I'm not even thirty. I'm not ready to wake up knowing that she isn't with me anymore. I can't take anymore. I have been crying all day.

I've posted here a few times before and never got much for replies, which is ok.  I really do hope I can get some insight on this particular issue however.

For so long I've been completely alone and it really sucked.  I managed to connect with my Cousin a couple of years ago and we've had a lot of great times, but more often than not lately it seems I feel bad after dropping her off instead of good that we hung out.  

We've hung out like 3 times a week for a couple years now.  I feel like we have a real connection but she doesn't show it if she feels the same.  

I'm an alcoholic and so is she, so we drink together a lot.  I certainly would be able to quit if I didn't have to drink to be around her.  Besides the booze I have no idea what other drugs she's into; I know coke for sure, probably smoking crack time to time, she's made jokes about wanting to go out and do meth all night.  

She's CONSTANTLY lying to me about everything.  
She is so very unreliable, in the last 2 weeks twice now she's made plans with me for the next day, only to show up on facebook at like 8pm after I've been sitting and waiting for her all day and then she gets angry with me for telling her it makes me feel like shit.  

Everything is always about her, she's even more depressed than me and has none of the coping skills I do so most of the time it's just her bringing up all her problems and me trying to reassure her.  If I try to talk about my issues though she pays no attention and changes the subject.  

I know she's not really a ""friend"" more of a ""company prostitute"" if anything, it seems like I'm always having to buy the booze or lend her money she never pays back.  I know I am being blatantly used, but the company is still better than being alone with my thoughts all of the time.  

She actually ""ghosted"" me about a year ago for a few months and that put me in a really bad place, I had to check into the psych ward I was in such a rut over it.  When we finally started hanging out again she didn't seem to care at all the pain it caused me, and I still have never heard an answer ""why"" she'd block me and dodge my calls or visits out of the blue.  

I feel like she's getting worse and no matter how hard I try I can't help her or make her seem to care.  

I don't think I can handle the pain of losing my ""friend"" again.  I also have OCD and I obsess on things to ridiculous lengths and this is going to suck me into a dark hole for a long time.  

I suppose I actually came here hoping people would tell me not to ditch her, but I know I can't keep letting her treat me like this.   

How do I do it on good terms?  
How do I get over it and not let the grief consume me?

294,"Ideas for sleep?
Hey guys, I’m not sure if I’m depressed, I’ve never been officially diagnosed. However, I feel a sense of deep sadness and fear almost constantly, but I hide it super well. The fear aspect seems to get worse at night, im not afraid of one specific thing it just turns into an overall consuming dread. I want to cry like 80% of nights but I simply can’t. I also want to sleep more than anything in the world, it’s my favourite thing. However, I can’t sleep, no matter how hard I try I normally lie awake for hours and when I do sleep I just wake up like 5-7 times a night. I only want to use sleeping pills as a very very last resort. I try to not use electronics before bed, or to watch something happy, but that feeling of being small and smothered and scared and full of dread is still there. Any ideas on how to make it better?

From my experience and one of a close friend who almost died in a car accident, I think people don't really want to die. We just want the pain to go away. All the shit we take  and all the heavy baggage we have to carry, just makes us tired and lose hope

When we ponder on death, we see an easy way out, so as to get rid of the unbearable agony we suffer. 

Moreover, I watched a video of suicide survivors. About those 7% who survived suicide, claimed that in their final moments, when they were throwing themselves from a high place, they said they'd regret everything and wanted to live. Now imagine all those who died and regretted in the last moments.

Personally, I've been close to do it, but my online friends gave me so much support and so much love that I noticed that it's not worth it. I still have things I want to do. Sure getting out of bed is still a huge task. Today it took me 2 hours just to do it, but I did it. 

I'm not sure if I should have posted this in suicide or here as it has to do with both.

I wish I could care about those things again but I can't so suggesting to do those things, as if I wanted to stop, is like a punch to the face. ""Oh your depressed? Just do what you like."" No. I don't want to. I don't want things I loved and feel nothing. It hurts to want to enjoy life and can't. To want to care and you just can't. I've tried medication and therapy.

305,"I feel trapped in a life I don't want to live.
It took a lot of time for me to consider posting here but I'm gonna be alone for the whole day and can't deal with it. So, hi, I'm just your typical British kid dealing with the stresses of College but the problem is that I'm not stressed because of college (I don't really care much for it but it's better then work), I'm stressed because of this constant cycle of: wake up, spend an hour trying to get up, be 20 minutes late to everything every day, eat, browse the Internet and sleep. 

All around me there's people who have clear career paths and know what they're passionate about, but I look at myself and realise that I don't have that. I have no interest in working in a job for the next 45 years of my life because there's nothing that I'd like doing. I'm doing fine in all of my classes (As in History and Cs in Maths, Distinctions in BTEC Engineering, everything just feels too simple) but I just still get these weeks where I feel worthless and pointless. I get brain fog, I end up teary eyed and can't talk to anybody for fear of looking stupid (I have speech problems). But then when I end up actually talking to others I apparently look happy.

I have spoken to people at my school about it, but it's the same thing every time. 'Oh you're struggling? We'll have a five minute conversation about your feelings and wait months to make sure you're not still sad'. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety but I stopped taking medication in July 2017 and haven't seen a doctor or therapist since. They didn't help, the medication I was on turned me into a god damn zombie and my therapist got exceptionally pissy at me for not telling the truth about my lack of improvement. I felt like I had to lie so I didn't waste their time and mine, I worry that's why I end up wearing a mask 90% of the time. Even around my family, who believe more in self-help then actually getting an actually decent therapist to try and help me. I'm ashamed to talk to them about it, no matter what anyone says, trust me when I say that they will NOT understand. I have been incredibly clear about it all and got mocked for it, some people just don't want to learn.

I had a pretty bad childhood that I try to justify my problems with (dealt with a lot of sexual abuse and my mother died in 2013) but when I'm having these 'days' I'm not thinking about anything in particular that would make me flighty. I ended up admitting a lot of my past to one teacher last week who I admire greatly and whom pretty much just saved my life and I am still cringing today. I know I have no reason to cringe either, I just get so nervous of social interaction.

I just don't get why the universe picked me to be its miserable little experiment. I never asked for anything bad to happen, I never asked to constantly feel tired and under the weather, I know that life isn't gonna be perfect but why is it that day after dull ass day I have to feel worse and worse? I try to take responsibility for my health, I feel like dirt, I have other people have some part in it and they take it for granted and hardly any of them actually make a big effort on me.

307,"I walked out of a job yesterday.
I took my 'dream job' in early January, only to discover that it isn't my dream job at all.  I thought I would like working in a medical office, but this particular medical office has two doctors, one part-time staff member, and a cluster of other problems.  


I quit on Friday; the owner asked me to come in yesterday and meet, and I did, but I didn't stay long, because she didn't show up and the other doctors on staff acted like my resignation never even happened. 


I've compiled a list of why I quit. Here's a short sample: 

- I hate the hours (7A-7P 3 days a week, 7A-2P 2 days a week; an hour lunch break was promised in the new hire handbook but is frowned upon by staff as a lack of commitment/dedication) 

- There are religious currents, including periodic 'prayer meetings' throughout the day.  I was treated dismissively when I objected and stated I'm not religious.  The owner is okay with the prayers, and says it brings staff closer together. 

- I was offered a management position, but after being hired, was told ""I know nothing, and might manage eventually, but right now was incapable of doing so."" 

- I was trained for three or so days before being expected to run insurance billing, keep rooms clean and do therapies, and run the front desk. 

- Staff is expected to remain available on evenings and weekends for PR events.


I know that quitting was the best decision - ""sticking it out"" would have been detrimental to my mental health, and I would have had no time to interview for other opportunities.  Still, at the same time, I can't help but feel like a burden to my husband.  


After leaving yesterday, I hiked 4 miles to the top of an area mountain (really just a big hill, it's a foothills mountain) and had a conversation with myself as to whether or not I intended to jump.  I intentionally didn't take my gun with me because I never know. 


I am afraid of being a disappointment, and I am afraid of never being a 'conventional,' 'functional' human.  I am second guessing my decision to leave. I already have other opportunities presenting themselves to me and I am lucky enough to have some money put away... but I don't want to be a failure. 


I can feel depression symptoms creeping up on me again, and I'm trying to fend them off.  I forced myself into a per-diem position today, just to keep in a routine. 


I'm trying to re-frame this as an opportunity, but right now, it feels like a literal nightmare. ",D
308,"Does Trading Help Your Depression?
Maybe I am a bit weird in this regard, but I do quiet well in this regard. I have not traded too much because of life circumstances, and thus the past few years have been depressed, as my one best friend is in jail and the other has adopted asceticism. I also moved to a new area and broke up with my ex. I have been thinking stuff over, and even though winning at coding can make me slightly happy, I feel like whenever I am trading I am on fire and feel like my ""true"" self, whereas otherwise I feel blah. When I mean trading I mean medium term investing based on value investing. IDK if the risk and reward part overruns me, but when I think about that I don't think about my lack of dating or how this or that sucks, I focus on kicking ass and taking names. Anyone else ever get a feeling like that? IDK if this is taking on risky behavior for the sake of it or merely finding my muse. ",D
309,"I've had no energy to do anything the last couple of days and I'm really struggling to get out of this funk
I've had problems with depression for years so none of this is new to me, but I'm having a really rough couple of days and think I'd like to just talk with someone.

Today is the second day I'm missing classes. My first one starts in an hour and I live too far away to get there in time at this point. I couldn't get out of bed, and had the same problem yesterday. I just get this feeling of dread when I think about getting ready and actually leaving, and all I feel like I can do is lie in bed thinking about different ways I could kill myself (I'm not going to, it's just something I seem to always end up thinking about in bed, I know it's toxic but it's comforting).

I really can't miss any more classes after today, this semester is really important for my grades. I feel like such a piece of shit for missing them two days in a row, this is the exact sort of thing that fucked up my grades last term.

Idk it'd be nice to talk to someone, about anything even. I only have one friend who knows I have problems with depression but I don't want her to deal with my emotional baggage.",D
310,"I Empathize More With the Dead Than I Feel Bad for the Living
There have been a few times in the past few years where I found out someone I went to high school with died of whatever means. But within the past few months, whenever I found out someone died, I didn't really feel bad for their family, I mostly was kind of jealous that they were gone and I was still here.

For example, my mom manages a nursing floor at a hospital. She told me one of her nurse's daughters died of a deadly disease at 20. And all I could think about was at 21 all I could think was how jealous I was of the deceased young woman, and how lucky she was. No ill will to her, I hope she rests in peace and that her family is coping.

Another example. When I was in high school, someone I knew had an older brother than went out drinking one night and when he came home, he died, choking on his own vomit.

Again, I feel like there should be a lot of cautionary tales in this, but mostly I just wish I was the one that was dead.",D

329,"My Fictional Home
   I stared outside, and watched the cold atmosphere awake me. The sun’s rays blocked by the magnificent beauty above us all; an urban scape filling my view around me. I felt a grave sadness strike all in the same spots for my daily routine, crippling what was left of my head. I grabbed the bicycle, and went along the path to any good in my life.

   ‘A nearly missed accident up ahead,’ I reminded myself. I hit the button to change colors, and awaited a stop that could mean a sour tardiness or a decent morning. The color changed fast, and I hastily sped across the lines between me and the other side. I arrived, striking the pavement at full speed ahead down the rubber sidewalk.

   A straight path to follow, a new future to envelop soon enough. The fact of the matter was that I had to pray to a god I didn’t believe in if I wanted to warp my happy spirit to glorious utopia. Logic overrides hearts quite rarely, leaving a snowflake and a shock of noise behind the mind that just wants it all to change. My bored mind only somewhat consciously bobbed his head around from side to side, keeping an eye on the reflective sign for a change of heart.

   The observant man coming by on a bicycle or on his own two legs could notice the hurting expression that shone on my face. An insomnia that has outlasted its course, half a heart to spare to the one it belongs to, and the tonnes lying on his stubby shoulders. Whether the man is out to care for their dog, the mail, something; they always take a look to glance at the face of a broken child, often not realizing the fine details in the street lights glowing on my frozen cheeks.

   ‘What did it take to find redemption?’ I often wondered, as grand sunlight was walking upstairs to knock the moon off it’s sleepy stool. I sat and watched a beautiful red giant approach, and drew images in mind to flicker about and echo in my concave dome of secrets. As the flickering opportunity ran full speed in front of me, I turned and felt the imagery toss into the incinerator. A great insecurity washed over the industry working ahead up above, slowing me down as I walked in slowly toward the place to call work.

   I sat the bicycle at it’s rack, hands in pocket as I blinked at the glaring sun. A numbness hit my heart, and for the next eight hours, I’d lose who I was, only coming back at the rise of a pounding rain. I walked from a distant building, taking the long path to a home that didn’t know me. I took the rugged bicycle, and stared up above at the shadowy clouds.

   I leaned forward over the handlebars, watching the patterns fly past my visions. I lifted up again, opening my voice to play a tune, looking for a face to redeem my little work. I went onward, and stared at the home that forgot me. I walked slowly up, placing the bicycle just where it was, hitting the kickstand which had sacrificed my ankle some.

   I opened the door, giving a brief greeting. I entered the meeting room of regrets and lost innocence, stroking my hands over what was a cuddly friend. My vision blurred, feeling the great exhaustion from the night prior taking me over. I curled in the corner, feeling the toilets flushing the pent up pains from an earlier disembarkment of a peanut gallery. I hugged the one thing that brought a soothing to my life, and proceeded to let out an ugly sob, trying to remember who everyone was, as I grabbed a broken mirror, staring at who the blurry stranger was in it.

   I felt myself faint, awaking to two strangers cycling the door between storage and the hands of all waiting for me. “What were you thinking?” the woman asked, “What did you say?” the man asking. “I don’t know.” I responded, lying on my side, as they both awkwardly stepped out, with a cracked expression of what was me walking out. I felt a blankness ride across my body, as I stared upon a wall that reminded me of life.

   I sat stationary, and buried my head under a recording of a person with nothing left. I held my heart, staring out at the dark that I wanted to escape in. A length that no person dared, but a low that felt necessary. I felt an unnecessary realism flow through me, as my arms folded, feeling a coldness drip down my neck.

   I got up, and went to the porch of attempting life again. A moon vanished above me, showing a pine away from me only just by some measurements. The bicycle appeared broken on the road, as I walked to what I remember being the last resort in this world. I walked to a reused bench, and stared out at the murky waters that felt like memories. I looked to my left, seeing a young boy sitting in the back of a delinquent’s wagon, and to my right a child amongst a smaller group, enjoying the finer delicacies of life. In between it all, a fool.

   I cracked my bubbly back, as a soreness hit my veins. I stood slowly, my body tossing and turning inside. The world turned askew, as the sun beat slowly onto my flustered body. I took flight across the ramp of a broken dream, taking a flip that would ruin me for a day. A nostalgia for the life that was simple broke me down slowly, as I felt my walking slow down. I sat by a curb, watching a teenager go away from a regretful sunset on a bench. He sported a terrible frown, forgetting of the one. A light flew by at fast speeds, turning away from my stretched out legs, as a noise emitted from it’s front.

   I stared blankly into the street, feeling my mind shatter into many jagged pieces. A dam blocked the feeling of humanity and a progress of going up in the world. I picked up the pieces, attaching them to my hurting consciousness. I stomped back to a filthy bed, staring into the bright light that fueled no purpose. I spread a message, the bait missing all parties.

   I collapsed, waking to a time of no reply. I logged into what made time fly by, and felt the pains of months wash away within seconds. A second half had joined, and I forgot about all the things around me for the next year. Dawn upon myself shined my sleepy public works to let out a shrieking cry, standing over a bin full of scraps and desperation to fix my bleeding innards. I panicked into a corner, awaiting life’s worst terrors. I stood to nothing, and returned to a hamper of depression. I stared at the dusty fan blades fly full speed, breathing in only to glance at the horrid truth.

   A shadow stood behind my forgotten figure, taunting the fullness above it. I wore a jacket and yelled at it, and it shyly walked. I took a deep breath and walked outside toward the bench once again, staring out at the beautiful waters. A creature came from the waters, approaching me. I held its hand, standing up accordingly. The creature pushed me into a pit full of spikes, as I awoke to half of me missing. I felt a burning inside of me, as my insides waned into a fine drawing of genitalia, washing the deliberate feeling and thought around my head, causing me to let out of a horrific screech of losing a natural ability.

   My body awoke in a new person’s home, as I stared out into the busy road below my sleepy figure. An old woman came out from the corner, as I nervously responded with a gulp. We shared an exchange, as I sat and pondered the shelves of a life that I knew little about. I explored the past, only finding multiple recordings of enthusiasts. I folded my hands, recognizing that I meant nothing here.

   The plane flew slowly away, as the shock went away from my skull, as my heart was left with a small hole. I sat and could not breathe, only feeling a great pain as we jumped into the chair of obnoxious actions. I sat and thought, glancing at the broken mirror. It was me.",D
330,"Is it better to find out your love was a lie, or never to have loved at all?
Last year, after 16 years of marriage, my wife says she never loved me, has never found me attractive (who can blame her), and doesn't think we've ever been right for each other. She only married me because she felt pressured from family and church to get married, and I was a ""good guy"", as she puts it. This crushed me. She has been everything to me. I have always loved her so much. My whole marriage has always been a fairy tale for me, it was everything I wanted. This was the girl of my dreams. I remember thinking when we were dating that it was too good to be true that any girl, especially one as amazing as my wife, would ever like me, since I'm shy, boring, and ugly. I guess I was right, it was too good to be true, and I should have trusted my gut and known it back then.

After a year of trying to find ways to connect with her, make myself more attractive to her, and hoping she'd love me, I've finally accepted that she never will. We are staying together for the kid's sake, and really for mine, what else would I do, no one else could ever love me, and I doubt I could ever really love anyone else the way I loved my wife.

Hello to anyone out there,

I'm just a good guy who didn't come from much and I'm trying my best to live a fulfilling life but I don't think I can anymore because of this illness. I use to be quite a geek as a kid and love video games and playing with others and having fun. I remember when I use to look forward to coming home from elementary school or middle school and just do my homework and then game away. It was so much fun then and I felt like I was genuinely pretty happy. Now a days I feel like i'm just literally dead. I don't do anything, I can't sleep, I hardly eat because I cant find the motivation to go out and get food... and over the past 4 years I have noticed that depression really has taken a toll on me mentally and physically.

It sucks so bad that I genuinely think I will probably die prematurely and die lonely. I have no friends, no acquaintances, and just family that don't understand anything about what i'm going through. To be honest I wish I was never born. I wish i didn't exist because facing the world is killing me.

Just the other day I thought about all the opportunities i've missed out on because of my depression. Like internships, jobs, career fairs, fun events and even a potential awesome friend but all of that isn't going to happen because i am as dead as a rock.

I turned 22 a couple days ago and no one even said happy birthday...Not even family. At this point i'm looking at my future and its looking dim.

I've simply lost the meaning of living. I have no self esteem, no confidence, nothing. Maybe people like me don't deserve to live a good life, perhaps we ought to die and just get over it.

If there was someone who can tell me my fate i'll want to listen to it now. I just can't anymore. I fucking just want to run the bridge and jump off but sadly i recognize that I only have one life. I'm hoping and hoping maybe everything can turn around for me but what are the odds to be honest.

I might as well have a heart attack and just die. I hate this. I'm lonely, i'm always sad and i'm just a piece of shit that is worthless.

Good Bye everyone. I hope you've all had an awesome day. As for me everyday is the same and if things don't change soon I think i'll rather end it. Not even graduating college meant anything for me. I fucking hate myself!

337,"Lonely and stupid.
I feel so stupid. 

I've always been academic and studious- if anything, I've dedicated my existence to the pursuit of knowledge, at the expense of forming human relationships. But I'm constantly overwhelmed by how much I don't know, how slow I am to understand concepts, and how my peers are all more intelligent than me. I know it's impossible to always be the smartest person in the room, but I feel that the fruits of my studies are disproportionate to my efforts. 

At the same time, I have conflicting feelings over my loneliness. I desire human interaction, but others find me rigid and distant. In all honesty, I'm easily bored by small talk and trivial discussions. I understand that it's important in forming friendships, but my under-stimulated brain seems to automatically 'shut-off' after a while. 

I've noticed that the people I do get along with are like me. Introverted, cold, and academic. We do not see each other as people, but as enlightened books with fresh concepts. These ideas are interesting to explore. If the book is lost, we are disappointed but not crushed. We were never bound by friendship; we were tied by our interests and perhaps mutual isolation. I don't feel an ounce of human warmth from these acquaintances. ",D
338,"I feel doubts about my relationship when I'm depressed?
I'm 25/M. I'm gay and I've been with my boyfriend J for five months.

I used to be severely depressed. But lately my life has been pretty good. But sometimes I get into a depressed mood and I start having doubts about my relationship.

Honestly nothing is really wrong between us. But sometimes I feel like I don't really love him, and that we don't actually have any chemistry. And I don't know why I feel that way. I start nitpicking our relationship and try to find flaws in it to justify how I feel.

But other times we'll both be in a good mood, and the spark is totally there, and I feel great about everything.

I'm starting to think that this is just what my brain defaults to when I'm sad, and that there's nothing actually wrong with us. For example this weekend I was feeling great, then on Sunday my parents had a conversation with me that really triggered me, and now I'm feeling depressed and doubting my relationship. (The conversation with my parents had nothing to do with my boyfriend.)

Basically it seems like whenever I feel down, my brain immediately jumps to ""maybe I should break up with my boyfriend."" I don't know if this is a sign that something is actually wrong, or if this is just what a depressed brain does.

339,"Advice for getting back in touch with everyday life?
I think the hardest thing for me, and the largest factor I need to address to try and feel healthy again, is simply trying to feel engaged in and enjoying the present. Right now, days have little to no meaning at all, and I am only really able to think of my life in terms of weeks, months, and years. As a result of that, I feel nothing from the hobbies or moments that would before provide me feelings of joy, satisfaction or just generally fulfilling myself. The only activities I really ""enjoy"" anymore is anything that provides me with a complete escape from reality, however these activities are not exactly one belonging to a healthy lifestyle.

346,"My best friend’s husband shot himself friday night. I’m angry.
He was a manly man. All of us. All of his friends encouraged him to get help but he grew up in a world, in a house, that thought mental health professionals were quacks. He thought that taking medicine for something going on in your head was weak. This was an entirely medical problem that could have been prevented. So I’m mad. At him for leaving my best friend a 26 year old widow, at the people who raised him, at society, for telling him it’s weak to take medicine, at whatever the fuck higher power may be responsible for this stupid, senseless waste. I’m guilty for not trying to do more. I’m heartbroken that I’ll never talk to him again or hear him play his guitar or see him turn a piece of wood into something beautiful. I’m confused by the events leading up to it. 


I just need help. I don’t know what to do. I’m spending most of my time with my best friend and trying to be strong and give comfort where I can. I don’t know what the point of this post is. Any words of wisdom, advice, thoughts, stories would be very welcome. Thanks for reading.",D

There are those who might really care about you and want to help but they have zero clue how depression works and their mindset is basically to tell you to get over it because that's what they do.

I should be grateful I have people that care about me I know, but its genuinely not that helpful when they brush aside how shit I really feel because they don't see a reason for me to feel like this other than just being weak. It's not even their fault it's just actually uncomprehendable to some people that you would rather not exist sometimes for reasons beyond your control.

355,"Getting motivated to get help
I was diagnosed with a mood disorder and PTSD ~1.5 years ago. I was getting help for a while but I dropped out of school and moved out of state so I just haven't been able to do that in the past year. I live with (and mooch off of) an SO but I've been fairly isolated for about 6 months. I've been doing online school but had to drop my classes this semester when I started working. Now all I do is this stupid part-time job. I should probably quit because it makes me incredibly suicidal. It's all so superficial. It doesn't feel beneath me but I really just don't mesh with it. 

Anyway. Health insurance. I can't figure out how to fill out the income stuff. A hospital near me has people that can help but I just can't find the motivation to even call them. It's like I'm trying to prevent myself from getting help. It's not even just psychiatric reasons that I want health insurance. I have a referral for a neurologist. I've been having memory issues, twitches, etc. I know I won't go without insurance. I probably could stand to get on birth control and check out some other persistent problems too but a) I know I won't be taken seriously and b) the only thing I genuinely like about myself is my mind so that's the priority.

I'm not completely not trying. I'll take St. John's Wort if I'm persistently suicidal but it doesn't help with motivation. I've been going to support groups. I'll ""decide"" to be motivated but end up collapsed and sobbing before I get out of the door. Play music, leave my phone behind so I don't get sidetracked. Tell people what I'm doing so I feel pressured to keep my word. Incentivize with promises of fast food, caffeine, or chocolate. I dunno what else to do. I can't even tell if it's laziness or depression or something else. The only thing that motivates me to go to work is fear which is also the main thing that prevents me from quitting.",D
356,"A Letter to My Future Self: Self Love
Dear (future) B,

This letter may be fragmented.

This letter may be short, or it may be long. 

This letter may be emotional. 

Most importantly, this letter is to show you that you can stay grounded despite the rush of emotions you experience when you feel vulnerable and [falsely] unloved. 

Everything you thought you knew since that day (October 21st) has become unraveled within the last fourteen hours. It’s hard to find the words that can sum it all up in order to save some time and space within this letter. This letter is also not about those specific events but about you and only you, and how far you’ve come; it all plays into being able to deal with whatever the future may bring. 

As you admitted this morning, to yourself and G, your sense of clarity evaporates when you begin to feel vulnerable. It leads you to a self-fulfilling prophecy - the exact neediness you exhibit will do the exact opposite of what you’d like it to do and will therefore lead you to feeling ever more “needy.” 

Listen to me: You are not validated by someone’s ability (or lack thereof) to love you. 

And again: Sometimes, it is not simply not about you. 

So far in your healing process you’ve managed to understand the importance of detachment. You’re making wonderful progress and I hope that at some point you are still progressing. Your existence is for you and for you only. It is not okay or healthy to live solely for another human being. Remember that you are not “incomplete” without someone however that someone can enhance the you that you already are. A relationship consists of two people working together as a whole yet existing as their own sense of “wholeness” outside of the relationship. That is so very important for you to remember for the rest of your life. Remember when you felt vulnerable just a few weeks ago (sometime in November) and wanted to dive into texting that boy in order to make you feel better about yourself? And then remember that you didn’t because you kept your clarity and understood that it was a coping mechanism. Don’t forget that you’ve done that not only once but a few times now and that is exceptional. I understand future Bri may encounter some setbacks and that her well-being might as well be a roulette wheel, but that’s exactly what this letter is for. 

As you’ve been told, you are luminous. You shine bright. Your heart is [almost too] huge. You have the potential to do great things. You are not your illness and you are not your insecurities. The grave you will lay in one day will only consist of you and nobody else. If the world ends and you survive, you have yourself. You have to keep this mind every single day. Work on self love and understand your worth. Yes, G makes you feel like the most important girl in the world. But before you can let him do that, you need to understand that you are the most important girl in the world to yourself, for yourself. 

You’re done putting your interests aside just to receive love for the night/day. You’re done with getting angry at the phone for not getting responses quickly. You’re done feeling unimportant or unloved because you’re not someone’s first priority. In the month and a half since the breakup, you have transformed. It is only the beginning but you have taken steps in the right direction. Future B needs to look back on this whether she’s in a good spot at the time or not. She needs to know that even though she may not be at a point in life she envisioned, she did something for herself. 

When you feel like he’s pulling away, don’t push harder. 

When you feel like you want to run to him in order to silence your overwhelmingly surfacing insecurities, understand that will not make things better. Understand that they are amplified and you are only expressing coping mechanisms in order to deal with the underlying issue. The issue isn’t that he doesn’t love you but that you make yourself unloveable. Understand that when you get into that mindset and lose grasp of the clarity, someone moving mountains for you will not fill that hole of pain. The only person on the face of this Earth that can fill that hole is you. You have the capability of moving mountains on your own when you remember these things. 

Continue doing your research. Continue taking time for yourself. Continue setting your phone down for hours at a time. Continue living your life out and letting others play a part and not the center role. You’re the star of your life, you lead the show. Your family, friends, boyfriend, colleagues - they play their roles in your story. Most importantly, they play their lead role in their own stories and similarly you are character. 

Learn to appreciate silence. Learn to appreciate a bit of loneliness and solitude. Self-love includes coming home from work to take a hot bath and drink a glass of red wine, not rushing over to whoevers house in order to feel loved by someone else. 

You cannot be loved appropriately if you cannot love yourself first.  

Isn’t it just like me to start taking the advice I’ve been given by so many people my entire life. 

Love yourself.
Respect yourself.
Appreciate your own time.
Respect others.
Respect other’s need for space. 
Live for you.
Again, love yourself. 


With love,

357,"I think i might be depressed , even when i'm having an ok life , is it possible?
I'll try to keep this as short as possible , no one likes a wall of text . 

Just as the tittle said , is it possible or i'm just seeing it all wrong?

Summary : I'm a 19 years old dude , NEET at the moment , life was never hard or cruel to me . Don't have many friends but all the friends i have are delightful to me , also my family puts no pressure on me and they are pretty positive overall . The only trauma i experienced so far was the breakup with my ex , but i moved on totally forgot about her . Just an ordinary life in general


But yet , i can't help but notice the subtle changes of my outlook , and in how i feel about life . I was 100% happy-go-lucky my entire life until the end phase of 2015 , but then something happened . Not sure when or why , because looking back nothing real bad happened to me , yet i started to feel more and more indifferent as each day passes . At one point i even stopped contacting people around me because i was like ""talk is ok but no talk is ok too"" , and even today i still feel that way . 

I still feel joy and moods in life , like eating good food , cry from very sob movies , but at the end of the day there's always something , it isn't feeling the same like how i had felt my entire life . I think it might be because i have no dreams or passions like other folks in my life , but i was always like that and i was always fully content with it .

On a positive note , good thing is i don't have any suicidal thoughts .",D

Dude, I know how it is to be depressed. I know how it is to be sick and tired of being sick and tired. Tired of the hate, tired of being tired of the hate, tired of being tried of being affected by the hate.

But what has worked for me and helped me rarely have SA or A these days was focusing on my breath when a thought comes.

Im 1 year and some months in since i started to liberate myself.

Currently im numb because of anti depressants and possibly supressing so many thoughts in my young life.

But i felt peace, i felt pleasure. So I KNOW those are real.

361,"I kinda like being depressed after dealing with anxiety
As a lot of people, I have both depression and anxiety disorders. 

Basically a thing happened in July, which caused me to have constant panic attacks and overall brutal anxiety until around October, when I just transitioned into deep depression. It was however a big relief. I was completely empty, I didn't care about anything. It was 100x better to me than fucking anxiety. When I'm depressed, I don't feel 'bad'. I don't feel good either, but I'm fine with that. I don't feel anything, it's kinda relaxing.

The downside - when I was in the deepest state of depression I was really close to killing myself and I also threatened to shoot up the school, after which police took me to a mental hospital. I've been here for over 3 months now. I did some really bad things, I acted really bad, but on the inside I felt better. When I'm anxious I don't do mean things to people, but on the inside I'm dying, I feel vulnerable and just want help.

I understand that depression is awful and people suffer from it, I see what it does to people on this sub. I just wanted to add my experience, since it's different to everyone else's.

Anxiety makes me feel like I'm having a heart attack, like I'm going crazy, I sweat, I shake, it feels literally like torture.

Depression is the exact opposite. It's calmness, not giving a shit about anything, basically relaxing. I feel kinda comfortable being depressed. I lie on the bed and look at the ceiling, at the wall, whatever. Like I'm on autopilot.

Right now I have both, which just feels fucking weird, I can't even describe that.

Sorry if I offended anyone. I know some people prefer to feel something, but I'm fine with being an empty shell.

tl;dr - depression &gt; anxiety for me.",D

I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this or not, but I need to get this off my chest. 

I’ve struggled with depression for about 3 years now and I’ve had my highs and my lows. Recently I’ve been doing okay even though me and my girlfriend mutually broke up, but we’re still friends and she supports me. And my birthday is coming up soon so I was looking forward to that. 

Today though I decided to go to subway to get a melt and I was just standing in line when this girl walks away from her friend and up to me. I thought she was pretty and was nervous about why she was talking to me until she asked “Are you a serial killer?”  That’s when my heart sank. 

I had just shaved and I realize I’m not the best looking guy in the world, but I didn’t know that’s how strangers perceived me. I kept a calm demeanor until I got back to my car and I just complete broke down and I was bawling all the way home.  I don’t know why it hurt so much, but I felt like complete shit. 

I’m trying to not let it affect me and not hit a low point so I hope sharing this relieves me a little bit. I am nervous about sharing this though. I’m just shocked that someone could say that.

We want to hear your stories, we want you to tell us whatever you’d like to say. In the end we just want you to feel heard. And of course, you will never be judged.

You know guys, we have all been there, in that cold and lonely place. For some, this place will be terrifying and called depression, for others it might be something less severe. But we don’t care. If it is important enough for you to feel bad about it, then it would be an honor for us to hear about it. 

Here’s how we work: below you have the email address where you can find us. Please write us. In your first email, you can tell us anything you want, though a little bit of your story is always welcomed (though not required!). And that’s it!

371,"I don't feel well.
Hey, I'm a highschool freshman and this has been the lowest I've ever been from the past three years of feeling like I should be gone. Buckle up your seatbelts because this'll probably be pretty long.

Since the beginning of this year, I've been wanting to die; I feel so lonely and as if nobody actually cares about me. 
So, there's my primary friendship group; the people I hang out with the most. All of my (2) ""genuine"" female friends pretty much don't give two shits about me because I tend to act really clingy to them and other people because I've been friends with them since first grade and don't want to lose them. One of my female friends is kinda popular and she barely talks to me, and I just feel like I'm undeserving of her time or something; she's also kinda claimed my other female friend, so I don't get as much time to hang out with them as I used to. My guy friends are also a bit popular and they also happen to be dating my two female friends lol. They do make me feel happy talking to them, and I do hang out with them a lot, but sometimes I feel like I shouldn't be hanging out with them all that much because then I'm ""stealing"" them from my friends. I also get pretty bummed not being in a relationship when my other friends are, and I do feel like I'm not needed amongst any of my friends. (Basically, I just feel like the rebound when one of my friends aren't there).

Can we actually talk about one of my female friends a bit more, actually? We'll call her M and my other female friend B. We met M last year and we invited her to hang out with us during our lunches. M was going through a tough time and we helped her out all the time and it was great making a new really close friend. She was really fun to talk to, but I don't know...sometimes she says some shit to me that makes me kinda bummed. I remember telling her how I felt kinda depressed once, and she said something along the lines of ""Stop asking for attention and actually do something"". Another time, I was hanging out with B's boyfriend, but the next day, M was mad at me and told me I shouldn't take him from B (which I do get and feel bad for, but B is totally cool with it and understands how me and her boyfriend hang out :p) Recently, (I don't remember what initiated the conversation really) M and I were talking (which rarely happens anymore), and she was talking about how she feels like she doesn't have anyone that actually cares for her, when she has so many people that clearly do care about her and love her. Then she proceeds to tell me to actually go and make friends again. I hate being petty and talking about other people, but I just don't feel comfortable being very close to her anymore and I'm not sure she's interested in talking to me either. 

So then that leaves like two male friends, and again because they're in relationships with B and M, I'm trying to pace myself with hanging out with them so one of them don't get upset. It's also pretty hard to make friends in a school where most people are white and really attractive, or already have their place. I'm a non-attractive Asian female that tends to make weird jokes and seem really masculine with the way that I mainly put forward, and I just don't fit in anywhere. I have a lot of anxiety of what people think of me, so then I sometimes struggle with talking to people. I wouldn't say people dislike me at all, it's just that nobody would hang out with me outside of school and it's hard to find people that are willing to spend time with me.

There's also the problem with others' expectations of me;; Almost all my life, I've been deemed ""smart"", which has caused so much pressure and anxiety throughout the years. My parents really want me to do well in school, and peers think I'm so great at everything. I *thought* it would go away after elementary school, but even here, people consider me being so ""smart"" and able to do anything. With currently a ~95 average in my classes, it's extremely difficult to maintain that and I feel like if I do any worse, someone is going to get mad at me. People expect me and think I'm so good, but really I'm just average at literally everything I do. 
I also have no idea what I want to do with my life. I'm not very good at anything, and I have so many interests, it's hard to pin down something that I *should* do with my time. Nothing really interests me enough to do it for like 25~40 years of my life, and the things I would be interested in have literally no way of making a living off of or is something totally unachievable. I feel like I can't make any difference to anyone in the world, and I'll die not making an impression on anyone or having anyone really care about me in the end.

I've been hurting myself since about third grade, mostly from scratching myself with my nails until it leaves a mark for a few days and hitting myself on the back of the head. It's extremely satisfying and I feel like it's a good thing to punish myself for being such a waste.
So that's pretty much the gist of it, I guess? Mostly just problems with self worth and having others view me a certain way. There is some other stuff, but nothing that I can really think of at the top of my head. These past 3 months have been excruciating, and I haven't gone a day without thinking I should just end it all and give up. I want to be happy, but that just seems so far away and I don't know if me living benefits anyone. Admittedly, I don't want to die, but I *do* at the same time? I feel like I have no place in the world and I can't talk to anyone about how I'm feeling because none of them are actually willing to hear what I have to say, so now I'm just dumping my feelings on Reddit. I'm tired of living and feeling like shit. I don't remember the last time I genuinely felt happy to be alive. I want someone I'm close to tell me that they love me and care about me and say I'm not a useless piece of garbage and that what I say isn't meaningless or invalid. I don't want to feel alone. I don't ask to feel alone. I feel alone because I am alone, and I feel like I can't tell anyone this because I don't want them to walk out of my life.

I'm sorry if this seemed really petty and like I'm just bitching about some shitty first world problems, because I know I am. :/ I just feel kinda down right now and I haven't been able to tell someone how I actually feel in months. 

So yeah. Thanks for reading, stranger. Sorry for the inconvenient text wall.

372,"I made a word cloud of all my depressive posts over the past three years.
https://i.imgur.com/hNbtyW4.png  

This is based on all the posts on my throwaway account (this is my main account and has too many unrelated posts to sort through) since 2014.  

I think it's noteworthy that some of the biggest words in the cloud are negative.  

While going back over these posts from so relatively long ago, I noticed that most of the older ones seemed like they were written by a total stranger. If it were somebody else saying those things about me, it would be called harassment, but it was me saying those things about myself.  All in all, this has really made me realize that all the things I have written about myself are way off-base, and are only true in my mind during a depressive episode.  

I know something's wrong, but I don't know what to do about it. In some ways I'm sure I'll always think this way about myself, regardless of what I do, but I wish there were an easy way to manage it.

I used [this](https://www.jasondavies.com/wordcloud/) word cloud generator.

377,"Does anyone else miss the person they used to be?
I've always struggled with depression, but sometimes it's more manageable than other times. I've noticed that with every new year and myself getting older, I begin to look back on my past and long for it, even sometimes breaking down because I miss the person I used to be.

I'm 23, so still young, but I really wish I could go back and be 19/20 again because that was when I was truly happy. I had moved out of my hometown, had lots of friends, a good relationship, I lost tons of weight and was confident for the first time ever, I traveled and worked for fun instead of working as a means of survival. I loved life, I had so much energy and such a bright outlook on everything and I had a lot of fun.

Now, that's all over. I really only have one good friend left from those times and he doesn't even live near me anymore; sometimes I get really down when I think about old friends and start thinking about things I could've said differently that might've prevented the arguments we had that would eventually lead to the end of our friendship, I really never knew how much I needed them until they no longer wanted me in their lives. My relationship fizzled out in the same way and I've yet to develop a connection like that with anyone again. I've also gained all my weight back and can't stand to look at my own reflection.

I don't know how to be happy like I was again. I look at old pictures from times past with old friends, destinations I went too and I want to cry because I just wish I could go back. I'm so depressed and hate myself, I'm incredibly lonely and am just a shell of the person I used to be. It's like I'm mourning my past life or something.",D

380,"What’s the point in living?
Obviously with the title you would think I’m sad and hate myself or am severely suicidal. In reality, there’s truth to that, but I seriously do not see a point in living. I’ve tried different things to try and discover myself like spending 1500 dollars on camera equipment thinking maybe photography is my calling only to return it the next week. I’ve bought a jeep thinking maybe overlanding or off-roading is my thing and now I’m in the process of selling it. I have 1 friend that I hang out with once a month. I have 2 real life friends that I text occasionally. I haven’t had a girlfriend in several years now. 

Mind you I turn 20 years old tomorrow.

I don’t know what the next step in my life is? Who am I? Is there something more to me than just working then going home just to sleep all day? I’ve had a small problem with taking pain killers like oxy, vicodin, and codeine. I just don’t find any joy in any part of my life. I don’t want to die, but at the same time I wouldn’t mind not waking up tomorrow. I just want a passion. Something to live for. I don’t want to be like this, but I’ve tried different things all my life and I’ve lost all joy.

Is there a way to discover myself? Is that even an actual thing? What am I missing in my life? I just want to look forward to living another day rather than dreading it. 

To clarify, I don’t consider myself suicidal. I don’t WANT to die. I WANT a reason to be alive.",D

So I was diagnosed with mood swings/mild depression quite a while ago, and have been on a small dose of Fluoxetine (Prozac) most of my life now.

Based on looking at objective measures, I should be feeling pretty content right now, but I can't seem to be happy about it, and only about the things that I hope I'll work towards in the future.

I guess for example - I've lost a little over 30 pounds since February, the first significant time I've actually lost weight, and I'm now no longer medically obese... but I still just feel fat and haven't been able to feel anything good about the weight I've actually lost.

I have a great job, and am just about to finish paying off all my loans, but I don't feel any accomplishment in that either. I keep thinking maybe I'll feel good when I have enough to put down a down-payment on a house, but I doubt that will be the case.

I have a bunch of great friends, but I'm tired of being single again. I know that I should just focus on the good things right now, but it's not seeming to be any consolation.

My faith life has been doing pretty good recently too, especially compared to the past, but I still feel like a shitty person a lot.

I have been going to the same psychiatrist for 6 years.  I have been on a high dose of Lamictal for 6 years to treat bipolar disorder.  I have gone to regular appointments and have had consistent refills.

I had a period of intense depression in which I went on a one month drinking binge and went to a hospital where I was given Ativan to deal with the withdrawal.  It wasn't a consistent prescription, just enough pills to ween off the withdrawal and ensure I wouldn't relapse back to drinking.

My psychiatrist just called me and told me she is terminating me as a patient and is unable to see me or refill my lamictal because I was prescribed Ativan by another physician.  I am freaking out about the effects of stopping this cold turkey.  I only took the Ativan for one week, two months ago.  I just want to have my lamictal refilled.  I need a refill this week, I can't find a new psychiatrist in time.

How is this allowed?  I sought emergency treatment for a substance abuse issue and am being unsafely yanked off a medicine I've been on my entire adult life.

385,"""I don't wanna die, but I ain't keen on livin' either.""
Sorry for the Robbie lyric. I just want to vocalize a bit before the rare fancy passes and I go back to soldiering on alone. I'm sorry if this rambles or doesn't quite make sense, but if I leave the stream of consciousness or reread I will probably delete because I loathe the idea of complaining to others or whinging knowing full well I've probably got it better than most people here. But a part of me wants to know that someone else experiences depression the same way, as some small solace.  
  
I'm never particularly sad, nor do I hate or wish harm upon myself or my life or the people in it. However, in every waking moment I have a weight emanating from my core, like a gravitational pull sucking in my ability to want anything meaningful.  
  
The best way I can put it is in the title - I simply don't want to *be*. And that's not because I'm overwhelmed by hardship or struggle, I've got it pretty good and there's nowhere I'd rather be. If, hypothetically, you took me back to before my birth and laid out an incredible life for me and said ""alright, you're about to be born, ready to go?"" I'd say ""no thanks, I'm good"".  
  
With a core belief like that there's no life to live. Career advancement serves no purpose but to consume more time, and I'd be taking a good job from someone who actually gets some personal value out of it. Romance is off the cards because someone who wants to date someone who doesn't want anything from life, probably also isn't worth being with. And heaven forbid someone should want kids! Hey Junior, daddy doesn't like his existence but he had you anyway, what an asshole.

I warned my mother that I read her diary and she was counting calories first in September. Earlier this week I told her to keep an eye on her cause I think she is depressed, btw I live in another continent at home and thus have limited access on how much I see them. My mom said she will keep an eye to see if she is cutting herself or not. We recently discovered that she does in deed and her circle of friends have depression too. She is being bullied as well by one guy at school and confidant has depression and is cutting himself as well. 

She opened up to my parents and one of close friends who is a professional who works with children a lot, isn’t a psychologist. 
My mom is very supportive as well as the rest of my family and we just want to help my little sister. My mom is not sure what to do, and neither am I. I suggested to look for professional help for her, as she is harming herself. However, we are not sure what to do about her surroundings. Most of her friends have depression and she is doing badly in school on top of that she is being bullied. What do you guys think?

14th birthday: All my friends but one bail on me. My parents scream at each other until my mother packs up and leaves.

16th birthday: My family and I go out to dinner to a restaurant that my dad chose solely because he had a coupon for it and buys the world's smallest birthday cake. Halfway through my birthday celebration the following weekend my friends abandon me due some drama bullshit that was apparently more important than me.

17th birthday : Dad starts an argument in the middle of a restaurant in front of my best friend. After we get home, the argument continues, resulting in my dad physically attacking my mother. All while my friend and I sat in my bedroom.""

To add to that, my friend's mother died of a heart attack on my 18th birthday, and I spent my 20th alone due to the fact that all of my old high school friends had moved on and my best friend had decided to join the military. Well, today was my 21st. My best and only friend completely forgot about me. My dad then made me have an emotional meltdown.

While I've been distraught and suicidal on and off since age fifteen, I've never been formally diagnosed with anything because I don't trust the mental-health establishment. I've only visited a shrink twice: once when forced by parents, a second time when pressured by a partner.

Because of this, I'm reluctant to claim I'm depressed except in the loose, colloquial sense. Instead, I feel my rage and despair flow quite appropriately from my failure to fulfill my desires, achieve my dreams, and so on. I hate being alive and would adore a sudden death, sure, but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm depressed, right?

I don't experience many of the symptoms of formal depression: I sleep pretty well most of the time, I eat okay, and I'm socially active. (I feel abjectly isolated, but empirically I spend a fair amount of time with friendly acquaintances at events and so on.)

I resist the medical model of my mental state because it assumes the problem's with me rather than with the world. I figure I'd be okay if I had the basic level of social success normal folks have: a number of close friends and a healthy romantic/sexual relationship with one or more partners.

I'm becoming increasingly confident my genetics and values combine to make forming meaningful connections with other humans effectively impossible. Because I yearn for such connections intensely, it's only rational that this dynamic would make my life unlivable.

I'm not depressed. My brain ain't malfunctioning; it's as valid a pattern as any. The uncaring universe approves of my mind as much as anyone's. I'm just not biologically equipped to thrive in the environments I find myself in.",D

Hi 

I‘ll start this with some backstory. A friend of mine plays in a band and last weekend I watched them live for the first time, it was pretty small with four other bands and maybe 15 people watched my friends band. 
Anyway their lead singer is a girl who gave some weird vibes while on stage, but she was also very edgy so maybe it was that. 
After the concert someone showed me her IG and I thought I‘d follow her. She and approved me and followed back. The first post she made after that was pretty much this summarized:
I am having a pretty bad phase of depression right now. I have no motivation, cant take compliments serious, hate everything I do and am overwhelmed with the smallest social interactions (there was more but I‘ll stop here). 

I personally have been struggling for the past few weeks with similar issues again and thought if it was okay to send her a message along the lines of this or if it would be intrusive:

Hey I saw your Post about your depression and can relate a lot to yo. I am a friend of guy and saw you live for the first time in city.

just because i’m better than i was a few years ago doesn’t mean i’m good. i’m better by comparison. but that’s it. and i hate being told how “great” i’m doing. 

but then i think maybe i’m just overreacting to the word “happy” because i’m more comfortable being sad. i’ve been sad for so long that there’s a certain comfort in it. sad is familiar. happy is unknown and risky. 

can anyone relate to this or am i alone? ",D

411,"Love is what makes the ride worthwhile
Without love, why suffer through anything at all? For what gain? 

I've had love, and I lost love. Love is so powerful a feeling, its a state of being. A person always has within him to very different personalities. That's you without love and you while in love. 

In love, I'm full of goals, ideas, glass half full, my bank account may be low, but it doesn't effect me. I can deal with anything while in love. I'm more confident while in love. I loved to buy her little gifts, make desserts for her, clean the room so she can relax after a long day, shower with her and wash her body, and of course fuck.

Out of love... I'm still in love with her, but we can no longer be together. I'm scared of the world now. Constantly battling anxious thoughts and worries. I spend my days now trying to stay above water, to not drown in the depression. But no matter how well I swim that day, the pull is still my depressive state. Everyday it's like I'm staring into a black abyss that probably goes down infinitely. It's hypnotic and my main goal for the day is to pretend that this gaping exist actually doesn't exist within me. 

So that's just what's been on my mind lately. My new normal. ",D
412,"I Just Want to Feel Normal
I’ll try to make this as short as possible, I swear....
And please bear with me. I know this is overwhelming and a lot is jumbled, but I have no other outlet....

I’m so tired of living.
I’m not suicidal by any means, and I’m not talking about ending my life or anything, but I’m so TIRED of living in the mental state that I’m in.

I can’t afford a therapist, and the ones that have been recommended because they work with your income are awful....

My depression didn’t hit until after my first child was born almost three years ago. Since then, I have been a WRECK, but have gotten much MUCH better over the course of the years. I’ve been on Celexa (60mg) for about a year which helped tremendously, but had to do away wth it once I hit my third trimester of this pregnancy (I’m currently 21 weeks).

ALL OF THESE SYMPTOMS happened before I got pregnant a second time, and have been intensified since becoming pregnant...

—I’m constantly moody. My emotions change with the drop of a hat.
—I’m constantly wondering why my husband stays with me (he is a GREAT GREAT supporting, caring lover) and am always thinking he deserves better
—I hate waking up on the weekends because I feel like I have no purpose (my almost-three year old is pretty easy to manage despite being rambunctious)
—I am too self conscious to even get out and do something if I know the place I want to go to will be crowded
—I have NO motivation to do anything. Walking to get some fresh air? Nope. Getting out of the house just for a moment to change scenery? Not a chance.
—Everything that I try to do I have NO attention span to continue.

Ive tried reading, cross stitching, writing, adult coloring books, ANYTHING to make my life seem more interesting and pleasurable....and I just can’t stick to anything.


I’m sorry. I know this post is all over the place. I don’t even know where to start.

IDK if this belongs here. Maybe it will get removed, but I feel like I need to vent somewhere. My grandma has struggled with manic depression a lot through her life. I've always seen her as this strong independent woman. She has always been my favorite family member because just how kind and loving she is toward everyone and everything.  No matter how bad life has ever gotten for me or anyone else she has always had positive words. Well I never knew it but she's a bottler and my dad told me in the 90s she snapped and try to OD roughly 20 years ago. Combination with anxiety and stress and lots of other factors. Keep in mind everyone loves this woman she has 3 granddaughters and 1 grandson and loving kids. This woman is a saint in my family. He we are 20 years later again. My family and I live in Texas, meanwhile they live in Georgia and my dads sister/ gmas daughter and her family live in Virgina. My aunt plans to move back to TX. So my grandparents were planning to move to TX since everyone on the East Coast is leaving. When it came down to sign on a Realtor she snapped I guess again.... These are people in there 70s trying to uproot their life again and move across country. She tried to OD on some pills and my dad, sister, and I hopped in the car yesterday and drove from Tx to Ga. My Gpa said he noticed she was eating less but didn't see the signs. Now we surprised her and didn't tell her we were coming. Amongst other family all were happy to see us. My Gma I could tell wasn't the rock solid woman I always known her to be. It made me realize that you can be 70yo and still have these dark thoughts and try. She looked so weak and frail. So here I am in a different time zone trying to support my gma the best I can. My sister doesn't even know, she just thinks she's 'sick'. This woman has all the love in the world and that still doesn't help dark thoughts. IDK how I feel, I don't know how I'm coping. It hasn't hit me yet I think... Also my Gpa literally would not survive without her. Like she's the one that makes sure bills are paid on time and basically runs the house. She's his guide and he'd be lost and a wreck without her. Hes so shaken up and worried. On top of everything my girlfriend just tried the same thing but a different method and her brother called the cops and she got 5150'd and I've talked her once in 3 days. When she called I had just learned about my gma and I feel like she didn't get the support she needed from me. It breaks my soul to think that this loving amazing person would want it to go all away and leave all of us behind. I have so many cherished memories of my grandparents. Sometimes I feel like I can get these stints of depression and I know it runs in the family. So here's me unbottling to you guys in hopes to here thoughts, prayers, and reddit love.",D
416,"How can I get my finances back to a point where I can go to school or to a point where I don’t hate my life?
I guess some backstory. I’m 19 about to be 20 in September. 

When I was in spring of 11th grade my mom got sick (Lupus or something, honestly she might be faking it but that’s a whole different post.) 

Anyway she went to the hospital and was there for about a month. I ended up skipping a lot of school to be able to care for and do all the general house duties for my younger brothers. (11yrs old and 1yr old at the time.). Things progress my mom misses a lot of work we end up moving with my grandma. 

Now here’s where shit really hits the fan. So tensions build between my grandma and my mom because of my moms suspected prescription opiate and Benzo abuse. Anyhow, dfchs gets involved (not related to the drugs but that didn’t help) about 4 months before I go to college and my moms health deteriorates seemingly out of nowhere. So freshman and sophomore year I’m juggling trying to work to support myself, school, and helping my grandma take care of my brothers. I thought I could handle it, I couldn’t.

Of course my schoolwork suffered and my gpa dropped below Hope eligibility. 

So I tried to find a full time job, and I did. Then got laid off not too soon after due to “budget cuts.” My first time experiencing adulthood.

Shortly after my car died and my depression got to a dark place.


What followed is 3months of applying to anything I could reasonably walk to (I was trying to search within 5miles) because transportation in the part of Georgia I was in was a huge deal and I could not get around. 


No jobs responded. Including the Walmart a mile away with a fucking hiring sign out front that I repeatedly went in to try and talk and build rapport with the managers. 

During these 3 months I took out 3 credit cards and ended up maxing them out. I needed food and other essentials that I simply had no money for. 

The depression kinda spiraled out of control.

I had a plan in place to hang myself but my friends at the time took the rope I was going to use and I was too broke to buy another. 

My dad who has been in and out of my life. Mostly out prior to this. Invited me out to come stay with him and his family in LA while I tried to get myself together.

I’m working hard, I found a job here. Retail but it’s a job. I’m waking up early, I’m doing noFap and I’m working out 3x a week to try to keep my depression in check. 

But despite all that, I want to kill die still.

I don’t see a future where I’m able to continue school. Dfchs told me they couldn’t help pay for college because “I wasn’t in for long enough before beginning college” but they had no fucking problem coming to my dorm and asking me questions and causing stress once a week. 

I feel like I’m barely supporting myself, and honestly I haven’t talked to my brothers since the youngest ones birthday (April 15th). Because I feel like I failed them. I haven’t talked to my grandma either because I feel like a disappointment.

And my mom keeps calling me every other month telling me she’s gonna kill herself because she feels like nobody loves her. Even through I bent over fucking backwards trying to help her by bringing my brothers to see her and making sure they could talk. 

(My grandma and the rest of my moms family won’t talk to her because she’s cursed all of them out horribly when they tried to be there for her)

428,"Everything has changed...
 About four years ago I was the typical loner. I was in the middle school. Nobody took me seriously, because my hobbies were not shared by anyone else. I'm from a small town, so it was difficult for me to find someone who actually liked the things I did. At the time I liked things like anime, video games and MLP. I am a 19 year old lass now and I only like video games now. 

  In the final grade of my middle school I met a girl. She was about two years younger but liked the same things I did. I was so happy to finally meet someone like me. We have bonded a lot and she was the first person I truly loved, except for my family, of course. 

 About two years ago we started to get distant. She kept talking to me about things I was uncomfortable with, but whenever I tried to talk about something that bothered me, she told me she was busy and didn't hear me out. It escalated in June of 2016. 

  I started talking to her friends, because they seemed like such wonderful people to me. Then we met up, all of us. She kept crying and making scenes. Few weeks before that, she accused me of liking HER friends more than I liked her. But when we all met, it seemed alright, save for her crying etc...  

  When I got home the next day, she told me off. Really badly. She told me to go to hell, called me all sorts of names and I feared... I feared I would never be able to find someone like her again. 

  I tried to end it. Swallowed sleeping pills and drank alcohol. I woke up the next day in a hospital. I woke up to a text from her. One that said she wishes my mother was torn apart by the girl's dogs...

 It's been two years. I've gotten better, met friends that helped me out a lot and I will probably never be able to repay it. But this past of mine, it still haunts me. I don't think I'll ever be able to trust someone like this again. I have gotten so cynical and careless about everything... It still hurts.",D

430,"My First Real Episode
Hey guys... I just really need to word soup to get things out that have been on my mind that I have not shared with anyone close to me, I feel as if this is the only way to fight this feeling of sadness.



So to start everything off, I never thought that I would be typing these words as I am now. Not to say that I'm ashamed of it, but just because I never felt I had anyone to share with. I never have felt like I was able to confide in my close friends or family because I don't want them to carry the burden of my troubles, and I used to feel like it would just be a form of attention seeking to try and explain to others how I feel sometimes.



With that being said, I feel as if I truly hit my lowest of lows about an hour ago and the sad thing is that I cannot really describe the feeling... because all it felt like was just a severe sense of nothingness. I felt as if I was experiencing an out of body sensation, and my mind could not calculate any sense of emotion besides this feeling of dread that was accompanied by a warmth-like feeling starting from the back of my brain and slowly taking over my head.



It's been happening a lot lately during the night... especially since I've been moderately sick lately and it feels like my body is giving up on me no matter what I try... eating healthy and exercising only takes away the feelings of loneliness and sickness a little bit. What really helps is interaction with others, whether it be watching live programs or being on xbox talking to people or being in chat rooms because it gives me a small sense of community and belonging that I lose when my mind is left alone to itself.



 I know it sounds stupid, but lately I've just been envisioning my feelings as the mind flayer monster from Stranger Things because it helps me make a little more sense of everything to a degree when I envision the feelings as something physical... I just wish it was a bit easier to find the focal point/issue that makes me this way to improve not only my life but also the lives of others around me.

431,"Having a really bad stretch of days..
Hi all,

I know this sub moves kinda fast but I just wanted to vent, hopefully some of you read this..

So my story is that I've had depression and social anxiety for about 15 years or so (at least that's when I recall starting to feel ""off"".. I'm 29 now).. Because of my poor decision to bottle things up and accept that I'm unhappy I put off seeking help until about a month or two ago in which I started going to therapy. It had taken a rather bad mental fallout that occurred in early December for me to finally reach out for help.

In my sessions we've been working on techniques to combat both my SA and depression, these include going to places alone such as coffee shops, yoga classes, shopping malls, etc. (Keep in mind I have ""functioning"" social anxiety where I can physically be around people but I'm extremely uncomfortable the entire time and have a very difficult time interacting with people).. The thought process being that my depression stems from loneliness and my SA contributes to that.. It's been a big step for me to try and go out on my own, but I've been doing it almost every day even though it doesn't seem to be creating any improvement.

Unfortunately the last few days have been incredibly difficult, I'm getting a very sick feeling of hopelessness and worry that my life is now just constantly shuffling around desperately trying to find something in the world that will ""fix"" me. I tried to sit at home last night to give myself a break and I couldn't even do that, I started becoming consumed by those bad thoughts and began having a panic attack.. So I decided to just go drive aimlessly even though we were in the middle of a snow storm..

I feel miserable again today and I'm just running out of steam to keep going, I really don't know what to do anymore.. I'm exhausted from constantly forcing myself into uncomfortable public situations but at the same time my home feels like a prison.. I have nobody to talk to or gain support from anymore, the couple of friends that I have all have their own lives with wives and kids and my family has been out of my life for 10 years and for good reason.. I know nobody has answers as to what I should do but I just needed to rant

Ive either tried it, wont try it because its not for me, or due to my circumstances cant do it. I thought I could just start drinking again. Atleast until things get better. Im confident that I can stop if/when i need to im just thinking about the health effects.

I just want to vent and have some insight. 

I never ""fall"" in love anymore. I'm lucky if I can even feel love. My current boyfriend is so supportive, but as the past few years of my life, just can't fall in love. 

I don't feel the own love or care for my family or friends. I don't care if something happened to my friends, and I don't care if I never see my loving, caring parents again for a long time, or ever. I don't care to help friends or family with anything. 

I have no passions in life. I have no hobbies. I'm not passionate about my family, friends, work, school, boyfriend, hobbies, my Jeep, animals, etc.. NOTHING excites me, brings me happiness or joy or peace. OCD, anhedonia and depression control everything. 

The only moments of Bliss I get are sometimes with my boyfriend, I get giddy about thinking about our future, or seeing a selfie he sent me while at work and make me swell. Those are occasional, but the only thing I ever feel that's positive to a somewhat major degree. I think my new birth control (first time on it) has made my depression worse. I don't believe in antidepressants for myself. I've been stressed out so much I've lost a bunch of weight too.

Now that I've vented, I just don't want to feel alone. I want this to go away. I want to be excited to see my boyfriend at the end of the day, and excited for the day I may marry him. I want to have a hobby I am passionate about. I want to go to work and be happy and thankful I have a job that I do. I want to feel love for my mom and dad.

Is it worth it to continue working as hard as i do at Work? All I ever do is get shafted  or picked on.

They know of my anxiety and depression. My mom drove me today and I didn't talk at all because I was in one of those moods I get in. I love my Mother a lot and she is very dear to me. I want to get out of this and become someone, but it is very hard. Anxiety has suffocated me and I'm afraid to go out in public due to feeling awkward and confidence issues.

458,"Debunking “stigma”
Everybody who questions psychiatry often gets the response “you’re stigmatising people with mental health issues”

What’s more stigmatising? Telling people they have biologically broken brains with insufficient brain chemistry, and bad genes? Psychiatrists/psychotherapist within the biopsycho model of human emotions, only drug, or involuntarily “hopstialise” people

Telling people they can’t overcome their problems with life due to their bad brain which doesn’t operate correctly and the only thing they can do is take a psychiatric drug?

Subjecting people to isolation and distancing themselves from people as “different” due to “mental illness” and subjugating the “norm” from the “mentally ill” subjecting people to drug trials they have ended up in suicide and mass homocide, all for the progress of “psychiatric medicine”

Telling people that they have biological genetic brain diseases like “schizophrenia” and they’ll never really live a normal life.

Yet we’re the stigmatisers? YOU’RE the one who solicitates a lawyer when you have tried a psychiatric drug that almost made you kill yourself now you want to fight psychiatry but you’re okay with kids being chemically lobotomised on Ritalin?

How many more expansions of diagnosis in the dsm? does it have to be to wake you sheeples up that Collectivising human behaviour and giving them a label of “disease” with symtomps does it have to be to tell you that these behaviours aren’t found through cellular pathology, brain scans, blood tests, or some medical diagnostic criteria?

How many more deaths, school shootings, senseless violence, suicide by the administration of drugs? Will it have to be to wake you people up that psychiatry has killed more people throughout the entire history of the world than the Jewish halocaust?

It’s time to wake up and see that the “stigma of mental illness” is just psychiatric propaganda to deflect all the damage and life’s runid by their tortuous domain and authoritarian political reign.

Wearing a badge upon your head saying I’m “bipolar” is self deprecative as you’ve surrended your mental factilites and human experience/emotion for the NIMH who’ve admitted you can’t define “mental illness” and want to use you as some priori for the campaigns to sell treatment therapy and drugs.

I am a 28 yr old M, who has been diagnosed with treatment resistant MDD from the age of 16.

Recently, I was attempting to get into a ketamine study in a NYC hospital and was asked a number of questions about my background. One item which came up that I have not thought about in a while was the specifics of my uncles suicide when I was around 13. 

My uncle was a 28 yr old gay M, developed HIV and killed himself. Though this is not what I was initially told. It took around 10 years with every year or so getting a new piece of information. Initially I was told he had cancer and died. Then I was told he had cancer and my grandparents ""pulled the plug"". Then I was told he was gay, had cancer, and my grandparents ""pulled the plug"". Then I was told he was gay, had HIV, and my grandparents ""pulled the plug"". Then, finally, I was told he was gay, had HIV and killed himself.

I think I secretly had an understanding of how he had killed himself even when I was a kid and was not told due to subtle hints that kids will typically pick up on. Even if I did not, I always had the feeling that something was wrong and that my parents were not truthful.

After discussing his death for two hours for the study, I realized that the depression I have been feeling for over 12 years is so similar to the feeling I get when I think of my uncle. Intense grief. I delved into the feeling more and have not been able to stop crying for the past few days about my uncle. 

Does this make sense from a psychological stand point to be greiving for this long? I know there is no time limit on emotions but does it make sense for my depression to be as a result of shoving down his death and holding onto it for all this time? I would love to hear some thoughts and opinions.

464,"I made it so much worse
Hey guys, haven’t been on reddit long, or this subreddit either. Never intended to post something, but recent events have changed that. So, I’ll start with some background,

I’m a 17 year old high school student. My best friend is 17 too, (Who will be referred to as Golf from now on) We didn’t even know each other before the school year started, but we had a couple mutual friends and we just... connected. It’s one of those friendships where it doesn’t really make sense, to anyone, let alone either of us, it’s like we’re family. It’s the only way I can describe it. 

Anyway, we’re dipshit high schoolers, so we joke about depression and suicide in our friend group. The group knows Golf has depression, they have no clue about mine though. Anyway, when I started hanging out with him I did what I’ve been doing for a year and a half. Joking about my depression and making jokes about offing myself. I didn’t know Golf had it until a couple months ago, but soon after we started hanging out he started joking about it too. Well he got reported to the counseling center, a couple of times in fact. But they’re honestly useless, so it didn’t help.
It came to a head last night when the group basically kidnapped him and forced him to go to a hospital. They didn’t tell me for whatever reason. I still haven’t figured out why. But eventually I got there. The night is a blur from there, I didn’t eat anything since breakfast, and that was noodles. As I’m just now typing this I realize that I’m at around 30 hours without food now. But that’s not important. I did my best to be there for Golf. He went home safe with his parents and is going to go to therapy/counseling. It was an awful day yesterday, a couple of events made Golf’s depression way worse for him. I’m glad we got him to the hospital before he hurt himself.

But it’s my fault, I know it is. I don’t need you guys telling me how it isn’t either. You wont change my mind. It is my fault, I taught him that suicide and depression could be treated as a joke. I made it worse. I hate myself for it. I don’t know what to do. Hell, I don’t know why I made this post at all. I don’t know if I want advice, or vent, or see if there’s someone else out there who has gone through something like this. Right now he’s on a trip with his mom and dad golfing.  Golf (the activity) is one of the few things he enjoys. All I want to do is lay in my bed and not exist in the outside world for the rest of spring break. I don’t want to take any attention away from Golf. He deserves it more than I do. I just don’t know what to do anymore.

Hey, first time posting here. Just wanted to talk to someone there since is not really any option irl.

I just kind of threw away all the good prospects in my life over the course of a week and have been feeling like a piece of crap. Probably not news to anyone here, that's how it usually goes. But tonight I feel okay. I recently decided just to drop everything and run away (not the first time I've done it, I've gotten good at it actually) and have been just sitting while I wait for finances to become ready.

This is a record low point in my life, but tonight I changed how I feel about it by just getting some chores done, getting drunk, and treating myself the way I wish other people would treat me. I'm talking booze and watching horrible telivision from the 80's 

And it dawns on me that I'll get another chance. I may have fucked things up this time but I've bounced back from fuckups before by just acting natural so I'm probably going to do so again. There will be more chances to treat people the way I want to be treated no matter what age I get to. I don't need someone to be nice to me, all I have ever needed in life is just to be nice to other people.

It's a silly sentiment but it's all I got right now, I hope it reaches someone else who can benefit from hearing it. If you pray, pray for me in the next three months because it's  all I got. Ask me for some nice nice words and I'll give some to you as personally as I can. Things get better when you're kind to others. No matter what the haters might tell you.",D

I felt like it was my own fault that I felt so sad and angry and that I wasn’t good enough for other people. One day I decided that if it we’re my own fault I felt that way then I could also improve my situation. Al my negative emotions went into working hard. 

I finished my studies (not by working hard, but because I was good at it) and put all negative emotions into working out. I got accepted into a difficult job at the Army. Now I quit the Army because of an injury in my knees. At the same time I lost a girl, even though we only went on one date, I thought she could be the one positive thing to take from the Army and all the hard work I put in to get into the Army. 

So what’s my situation now? Jobless, girls still despise me, have a degree with which I can’t find a job with and all the work I put into improving my situation was for nothing. 

While trying to improvie myself and during my studies and time at the Army I still had periods where I felt very down. It just becomes harder and harder and harder to crawl out of it every time. The negative voices and feelings are too much and getting up to fight just becomes impossible.

I had the power once to get up and try to fight. Now I don’t even have the power to suicide. But I just wish it was all over. 

Eventhough it feels useless I might go to a psychologist. How has it helped you guys? I wan’t to end it all but I don’t want to end it all. I don’t know. I feel lost and sinking deeper every damn time.

F early 20s. I never finished college, came home, and I've been so depressed that I haven't done anything since I left school in 2016. I'm a really hard worker and I've always been liked by my bosses, but I don't feel comfortable giving references because any part time jobs I've had I kind of - just - abandoned. I would get to a point where I couldn't handle the social anxiety and depression and my job would call me to see if I wanted to come back during a break from school and I would never call back. Now I'm in this weird limbo that I don't know how to get out of because I basically don't have any credentials or references and there's a massive gap in my resume that I can't explain. ",D

I have tried so hard through most of my life to feel accomplished, to live a life I can be proud of. To love and be loved. But every day is another act of failure and rejection. The days get heavier and heavier. I’ve run out of strength. I want to stay in my bed. I want to stay in my dream world.

So lately I've been unable to write at all. So I decided that if I can't get the inspiration, I'm writing about why I can't get this inspiration, and instead of writing another dadaistic poem I tried to do something you guys might like, so I want to share it.

 inb4: This is the first poem I'm writing in english so yeah. I hope you enjoy it, even though I couldn't think of a title


**Goddamn Shit**

No Focus on Nothing  
Nothing stays in Focus  
Why the fuck can't I be  
somebody else's Focus

When I start to write  
My whole mind goes white  
""You wann' cry tonight?""  
I wish I could tonight

I can't wait to sleep  
But I'm afraid of dreams  
The thought of morrow  
makes my mind go scream

Cold sheets, I wait to sleep   
Everyday, everyday, repeat.

489,"Reddit Secret Santa Saved My Life...
I want to begin this by saying that I've been in a really dark place recently. Combination of family issues, breakup, and finals put me in a really depressive state. As a result, I'd been having strong suicidal thoughts for weeks. I had been seriously thinking about ending my own life. So that's the context in which this occurs. 

About a month ago I signed up for secret santa on a whim. I had never done it before and honestly didn't expect anything. But yesterday, my gift arrived. I don't know who this person is, but they spent at least $150 dollars on about 6 separate gifts. They also included a really thoughtful and touching letter that talked about how they thought I was such a great person and how much they enjoyed learning about me. 

I immediately broke down crying upon reading it. 

It might seem small or sorta stupid, but it made me feel like someone cared about me. That I wasn't the idiotic nobody my depression tells me I am all of the time. I felt motivated and happy for the first time in weeks. I cleaned my room and did work that I'd been ignoring for months. I finally felt like maybe, just maybe, I meant something. 

It changed my life, and probably saved it. 

So whoever you are, thank you so much, and I can't express how much this meant to me or thank you enough. 

And let this be a lesson to everyone else. The smallest act can and does make a difference. Let's all try and use the Christmas season to ensure everyone feels a little more loved. ",D

Attempted suicide May 1st, wasted a week of my life in “voluntary” inpatient, was put on the one drug that has ever helped me (olanzapine, an antipsychotic) which I then promptly had an allergic reaction to, got off of, and crashed again. Was able to drag myself through some intensive outpatient group therapy for a while and then quit that too. The only good thing I have left in my life is my fiancé. I know it’s not healthy to live for another person but I’m not exactly in a position to nitpick. At this point all I can do for them is try to be as reliable as possible while also isolating myself more often than not so that they don’t have to deal with a constantly suicidal person more frequently than they can handle. But I want more? I want to be able to grow with them and be an active part of a life they enjoy? I want to repay them for all the things they do in vain to try to make me happy?

492,"[Need Advice] Need anti depressants but I don't want my mum to know about it.
Hello guys, I am 17 and I live in Singapore with my Mum. I have been depressed on and off for the past 5 years with serious suicidal thoughts for the last 4. 

I really think that it's time that I start anti depressants because I reckon it would help me tons. The problem is, I don't want my mum to know because the last time I opened up about being slightly suicidal and very depressed, she freaked out on me (don't need to get into details.) She has had a history with it herself and I know that if i ever took my life, it would permanently ruin her. 

At this point, medication is my last resort. I've had a girlfriend and it made no difference whatsoever, I still feel empty most of the time and would rather die than anything else.

I've lost all motivation for my academic life, have basically no ambition left and have just been floating around doing nothing the past few years. My parents trusted me and are probably disgusted by me right now.


I've lost all my Bitcoin in a fire. I was one of the early pioneers and had literally a couple hundred thousand dollars worth not too long ago. I'll admit this one was getting to me quite a bit. Especially since I could've prevented it.

But you know what really incited and is still by far the biggest part of my depression? A girl. A stupid, uninteresting, normal ass girl. But I love her. I love being around her. And she probably doesn't even give a shit about me because she has a boyfriend. We hung out at a park and had a great time, we always do when we talk... But she's never the one to start a conversation and never offers to hang out. Okay, boyfriend, but at least let me be your friend. Just planning a meetup is such a pain the ass. I wish you'd just tell me to fuck off, but you keep saying yes. All while you straight up don't give a shit about me.

Hope is the worst part. I'm still clinging to my failing studies, new random ass coins and this *fucking* girl. I can't even concentrate on the other two because I think of her all the time. I'm desperately trying to stay relevant to her in hopes I can catch her when she is available again and I feel like such a fucking creepy loser. All for that small chance.",D

497,"I think I ruined another friendship
TL;DR: Made a wonderful friend, had a depressive episode, and ruined the friendship by trying to force my problems on her. Just like I've done a million time before.

I've had depression my whole life and I've always gone through episodes. Sometimes they're mild, and I'm just generally down for a few days, sometimes they debilitating and I can barely get out of bed for weeks. I've also never had a lot of friends. I don't have casual relationships. I either don't really think of you a friend, or I love you with every part of my heart. There's no middle ground.

I've been building a friendship with a great girl from work (call her Amy) for a few months. It doesn't seem like anything romantic is gonna come from it, but it was nice to have a friend I could do stuff with. We went hiking, rock climbing, we even went on a scuba trip to the Caribbean together. I'd opened up to her about my depression and she seemed really understanding. She actually seemed to appreciate how open and communicative I was about it.

The day before the Super Bowl, I felt an episode coming on. It wasn't severe, but it made me fragile. I'm a big Patriots fan, so when the Pats lost, it set me up for a bad episode. If I'd just been sad about the Patriots Monday and let myself heal like I usually do when my teams lose, everything would have been fine, but instead I started to blow my friendship.

I texted Amy Tuesday that I was feeling down and I'd like to see her. I made a big deal about how I wasn't crying about the Pats, but I was having an episode. It seemed important to me to point that out for some reason. She said someone was visiting from our India office and had a ton of work for her, but she would try to come over after. She worked until 930 that night and never made it.

Wednesday I left work at 10am because I was too down to stay. I was texting her the same stuff throughout the day, how I was sad and I wanted to see her. She worked until 930 again and didn't come, but this time she had never promised to. I texted her this big apology about how I've been a shitty friend and I'm sorry for forcing my problems on her. At work Thursday she told me to stop apologizing for everything. I told her I would try to stop.

Friday just felt different. She was less talkative with me than usual. She brought me cookies she made, and I thought that might be a sign that things were getting better, but after work I asked her if she had plans that weekend, and her answer was simply ""yes"". I said have fun and left. Normally she would have at least told me she a general idea of what she was doing.

I talked to my roommate/best friend (Samantha) about it Friday night. We agreed I needed to just leave Amy alone for the weekend, so I texted her and said if she found any free time I'd love to see her and then I didn't contact her again until yesterday at work.

Yesterday some things happened that really made me feel like things were ending. First, we had talked about planning a trip President's day weekend, but she had a surgery and she didn't want to plan anything until it was done (that's a whole other thing that's bothering me). When I asked her yesterday, she said she thought President's day was in March and she promised to see her brother this weekend, so ""we'll see"". She also told me she likes working late and going to the gym at like 930. Apparently she's been working 12 hour days for the past week. The gym part hurt because one of my favorite things to do with her was work out, and now I've lost my gym buddy.

I've had a lot of friendships go this way in the past. Speaking a little immodestly here, but when I'm not depressed, I'm funny, energetic, and interesting, and generally a fun person to be around. I've had lots of people enter my life, meet that me, like him, then after a few months meet the depressed side of me and just nope the fuck out. 

Amy first met the depressed me a few months ago and she didn't run away. I thought she could be a big part of my support network moving forward. But I'm worried that I just tried to put too much on her. Like I've done a million times before.

The worst part is she sits right next to me at work. She's leaving next month to hike the Appalachian Trail, but until then, if I really did blow this, then I have to sit next to her every day for a month. I don't know if I can handle that.

Anyway, thanks for listening to me whine about my problems.",D

It made me really sad because even though I have a wide circle of acquaintances, my mental illness and my fear of rejection makes it so hard to actually get close to people. I’ve been in college for a year and a half and I still don’t have any close friends that I text or hang out with. My friends from high school are all off at different colleges living their own lives now, so we aren’t close anymore.

505,"Drank too much and ended up in the hospital
Let me start this off by saying I’m underage, so that just makes this just so much better. 

Anyway, a handful of months back I had the smart idea to get drunk by myself. I don’t know what did it, I only drank a few shots, less than what I normally do, but whatever I guess it was destined. Next thing I know, I’m waking up all wrapped up in IVs with my mom next to me. I’m confused as all living hell. My mom just says “you drank the vodka,” looking more devastated than I have ever seen her, and then I cry myself to sleep.

Now I’m ruined. I’m broken. The guilt eats away at me all the time, constantly. As soon as I think of my family that’s all I can think of. Apparently I was found in a aggravated state, and upon being discovered I punched two holes in the wall, along with attempting to put in a hole in my father’s head. God I fucking hate myself. I’m not even a violent person, I hate hurting anything. Being anywhere around my home or family just makes me unbearably sad now. I had to come home and look my brother in the eye, and apologize for being so fucked up I tried to not only punch my dad, but a police officer who was forced to restrain me. By the way I don’t remember any of this, all of this my parents told me. You know how much that hurts? Not remembering a night at all, and it turns out you ran at your dad screaming, “fuck you I’m gonna kill you”

I hate myself.

I’m so full of regret and guilt and self hatred all the time. I hurt my family so much, and I continue to. I’ve had multiple emotional breakdowns since, when pretending to be okay just becomes too much. I’ve made my parents so concerned for me. Not only do they constantly think I’m high now, and do not hesitate to think every single fucking broken thing is my fault because I got “too fucked up”, but with the emotional rants I’ve had I’m sure they think im about to blow any second and kill myself. 

I ruined everything. My relationship with my family is ruined. I love my parents beyond belief, and I know they love me too, but the shame, and the sadness I feel just being around them, it’s constantly unbearable. Nothing feels normal anymore. It hasn’t since that fucking day. I would give anything, literally anything to go back. I’d rather be completely paralyzed than do what I did to my family. 

I have no care for myself at all anymore. I hate myself more than any other person. I’m selfish, impulsive, lazy, stupid, and above all less than worthless. If I wasn’t born I’m sure my family would be much more happy.

I can’t kill myself, because then I’d kill my whole family. My mom straight up told me if I kill myself that will be the end for her too. I don’t know what to do then. I guess slowly shrivel away or hope I get ran over. ",D
506,"I’m trying to get communication back with my best friend. I have an idea, it won’t be easy and it may never work, but it’s worth a shot?
Long story short: I’ve been depressed and I have a friend. I could make a 5 paragraph story about my friend and my depression. But I want to get to the point. I don’t want to make this post too long otherwise no one will read it.

My friend made the decision to stop communication with me until I go to a residential psychiatric program or somewhere similar. The thing is I’ve been in one already, it was a pretty flexible place, cell phones were allowed, doors were never locked, etc. Long story short I became “too high risk” and am not allowed back. And I don’t want to go back. I don’t believe in happiness by mental health, I believe in natural happiness. I believe that all humans deserve to feel happy without being told “your life sucks so you need pills and mental health treatment to be happy.”

So anyways, I can’t fulfill his wish. But getting communication back with him is all I want. There are no exceptions.

So here’s my idea. Just for fun I livestream games on YouTube. I do it for fun, not for fame, I don’t play those popular games, I play the ones that no one plays. It’s unlikely for a video to get more than 100 views. But I’ve considered starting a new channel. I will livestream games, post videos about my custom Guitar Hero songs (I do that for fun too) and just pretty much show that I’m having fun. But the big goal of the channel will be to “get my friend back”. That’ll be the whole idea. That will be written on every video. That’s what the channel art will say. Think of it as a gofundme, only I’m not asking for money, I’m asking for support from the public to hear my story, hear what I’m doing, and to be there with me when my friend does deliver.

Here’s the catch. For obvious reasons, his name will never be revealed. No one will have any idea who my friend is. But little by little, I will try to reveal the channel to him. It’ll start with the channel being named “Ian”, then sooner or later add my last name. As time goes on I’ll try and find ways to give him clues about the channel without actually telling him anything.

The big dream is that he eventually discovers the channel, and with whatever support there is, he will see how much I’ve mentally improved over however long it takes.

This all may sound totally silly, totally bogus, yeah, maybe this will never work in a million years. Just a wild thought that I’m going to attempt anyways. I might edit this post with a link to the channel depending on the response here.",D

To The Person I Miss The Most,

Happy birthday man, I miss you and I’m sorry. It feels like so much time has gone by that any attempt at reconciliation would do more harm than anything else at this point. We used to have so much fun, but nostalgia only makes everyone feel worse, and more often than not leads to poor choices. It’s a sweet substance, like sugar, just with a punch in the gut to remind you that you can’t ever go back to something you once valued so highly. 
	
It’s been a year and a couple months since we’ve talked, and there’s rarely a day where you don’t cross my mind. I’m not saying that’s healthy, because it sure as hell isn’t, but who cares anyways.
	
I wasn’t good for you, you were too good for me, we crashed and burned and I loved every second of it. Was it worth it? Maybe. Does that matter? Not in the slightest.

Now I just sit alone in the dark writing you letters that I know you’ll never fuckin’ read, pretending in my head that there’s some fucking way that i can salvage the situation. It’s like watching someone stand at the bottom of the pool drowning, when all they have to do is swim to the surface.

I’m cold, and tired, wasting time and throwing away opportunities left and right because i have no idea what I’m doing, and I know that you’re doing well, that makes me happy. You deserve to succeed. 
	
You’ve been to hell and back, and I might as well have been the chauffeur for a good portion of it. 

I loved you, I don’t think I do anymore, but I know I did. I thought about comparing how I felt about you with a bunch of shitty metaphors but let’s be honest, that isn’t our style. We’d probably laugh at how cheesy it was and how stupid this whole situation is and then we’d pull out our guitars and write a beautiful sad duet and I’d be out of tune while you hit every note perfectly. But you wouldn’t critique me, that’s just the way you are. 

Too kind, and sweet, too good to everyone you came across even though you knew there was a pretty good chance that they’d never return the favor. And man I really tried to, all those times we walked around talking about how much we wanted to die and how sad we were, but the whole thing was build on the back of our own loneliness and sadness. 

But that’s the past. Nostalgia is bullshit, but I have to indulge once in awhile just to feel something, I’m sure you remember that.
Here’s to better times ahead, and a letter left unread.
Sincerely,
Your Old Best Friend

509,"Intense feelings of not wanting to exist/ wanting to escape and be alone somewhere forever
I'm a first year in university and have suffered from depression since middle school. I've been able to manage my depression by having really supportive friends and through that, felt like I had a purpose in life. However now entering university, I feel like I have no purpose, no reason to exist and it is a lot harder managing my depression. I fill up my time with work and sports and stuff as a way to distract myself, but I just feel like I am going through the motions of life and everything just feels hallow. I think dying is such a pleasant and peaceful idea and am totally okay with it. I feel like I don't have any actual friends even though I go out a lot, and I feel like I have no impact on other people's lives, like they can go on so easily without me being there. 

On top of that, I feel like I don't belong anywhere since leaving highschool. I feel like I don't have a place in college, even though I got into my first choice school. However, I am too afraid to drop out because that lifestyle seems even more daunting. I really want to go someplace where I can live out my life in seclusion and just get away from anything.

And that's what another member tried to pin on me. He or she quickly went into offensive and started preaching about how selfish it is to want to be in a relationship if you're depressed, how I should go seek therapy and that I should realize that relationships aren't a magic cure.

Today was one of those few days I get that I don't have any class or shift. I got carried away and stayed in bed until 2pm. My mom suddently came home from work (while still at her work, don't know why she even tries to sneek out) pretty much came home to yell at me to get up and clean my room. I always think she forget that I do have depression with medication and have attempted several suicide method. 

I'm working as hard as I could but she still thinks it's not enough. She's one of those ""the harder it hits the better it gets"" person. She wouldn't understand that hitting hard could break things.

Oh yeah, she also kicked my head to wake me up. That's a thing.",D
513,"Addicted to escapism
If I am not occupying myself with any form of entertainment (games, books, movies, music, drawing, writing, etc.) I feel depression and anxiety. Whatever I do in real life, there is a heavy stone in my chest, if you know that feeling. I cannot escape sadness, boredom and loneliness whatever I do. I only feel really good when I sleep and have wonderful dreams. ",D
514,"Today I looked in the mirror and thought to myself for the first time ""that's a beautiful person""
Then I played xbox 6 hours non stop and looked in the mirror and thought ""who am I"" 
I need to stop a lot of habits if I want to get rid of my depression.",D
515,"I haven't touched another person in 4 years.
I know it sound weird and creepy but i don't mean it like that. I mean hugs. I just want a hug. That's it. I don't have anyone to really love and i just feel so tense and alone. ",D
516,"Does anyone feel like no one has any nice things to say about you?
I hear everyone say nice things about other people. I wish someone would call me fun, energetic, smart, cute. I swear I never hear it.",D
517,"Want to read my texts about depression?
In past few days I've been writing little texts about my feelings and depression ro help me get the bad feelings out of my mind.. I was wondering if my you guys were interested in reading them?",D
518,"Nightmares and dreams
HI, I don't know about you, but when I was a kid I used to have this weird nightmares (not the teeth fell out usual nightmares) Like getting lost in a winter forest in pijamas just to be eaten up by wolves, being totally awake at my bed while insects ate me alive ( like sleep paralysis but dreaming?) or just watching my mother being eaten by feral dogs as she protected me.

Anyway, as I grew older and my depression grew with me, I stopped having nightmares, I can barely recall when the last one was. Instead I have pretty vivid dreams (not lucid ones) and in most of them, I'm at some kind of weird scenery where I feel like I've always been there, and weird shit happens that I can remember, and it's like a full story, a lot of different things happen in the same dream. The problem is, in most of them, I meet someone, normally a girl, with which I start a mutual relationship after overcoming some hardship, like, my biggest desire. These dreams, as good as they sound, are worst than the nightmares because when I wake up, it takes some time to realize that I did not live that shit, that I'm still in bed, and I'm still alone.",D

520,"No one wished me on my birthday
Yesterday was my birthday and none of my close friend wished me  except for my family members. I wish all my best friends at exactly 12:00 clock , video-calling  or texting whatever suits them. I normally avoid attention and don't care about such things but this really bugs me. They are the friends that I meet everyday and had expectations , just a acknowledgement would make me happy. I know this sounds like attention-seeking behaviour and I generally don't care about such things. I am happy in under my own skin but this makes me a bit sad",D
521,":)
So yesterday was my 18th birthday, and here my dumbass was expecting it to be different than all my other ones, but boy was I wrong. It's nice to know that no one gives a fuck about you. You can cry, and scream all you want but at the end of the day, no one is gonna be able to understand you, and the deep well that has been buried within your mind. So what if you grew up rejected by every girl, guy, and person? So what if you've just turned 18 and endured waves upon waves of mental abuse? At the end of the day, when you're laying in your bed, and your demons are starting to swallow you whole and fill up the bowl, what do you do? You face it. You indulge yourself in them until the pain is numb, and you can't feel anything anymore. It may not be healthy, but it's better than suffering. Happy fucking birthday bro, have your cake.",D
522,"Do you ever go to bed planning on losing the next few days?
Im about to fire up some South Park and go to sleep.  I've already planned on being useless, despondent, and out-of-touch until at least Tuesday.  I will be dead to the world.  I will not answer your calls/texts.  I will not leave my couch. I plan on hiding from everything and avoiding everyone for at least 72 hours.  I'm shutting down intentionally.  I'm making it a plan.  Fuck you, bye.",D
523,"School failure
I think I'm doing something wrong. I found myself in a situation where I was lucky to move to prosperous country. Except I'm 27 with no degree, no proper work experience, just some odd jobs. I'm an embarrassment compared to other immigrants. Last year I began studying for the first time since high school , just to realize the field does not interest me. I barely even understand the language. My GPA is horrible. And I can't change schools for at least another 2 years due to family. I can't even get a job because my town has almost none, and the ones it does have are given to the natives (I'm foreign). The welfare covers my expenses for now but this is not a life I want to live.  I'm also anti-social and seem to fit the symptoms of ADHD, but my therapist claims it's just anxiety disorder and doesn't wanna prescribe any meds yet.  I do have a serious learning struggle even when language is not an issue, I can't seem to grasp the concepts unless teachers spell it out for me. Basically I'm unable to learn anything the moment it goes past the basics and it's rather depressing.",D
